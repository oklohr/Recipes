[Sun Dried Tomato Basil and Parmesan Orzo with Chicken - Cooking Classy](https://www.cookingclassy.com/sun-dried-tomato-basil-and-parmesan-orzo-with-chicken/)

## Ingredients
1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into 3/4-inch pieces
1 Tbsp + 1 tsp olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/4 cups (8 oz) dry orzo pasta
2 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth, then more as needed (don't use regular broth, it will be too salty)
1/3 cup sun dried tomato halves packed in oil with herbs (about 12 halves. Shake off some of the excess oil), chopped fine in a food processor
1/2 - 3/4 cup finely shredded parmesan cheese, to taste
1/3 cup chopped fresh basil

## Process
Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. 

Once shimmering add chicken, season lightly with salt and pepper and cook until golden, about 3 minutes then rotate to opposite sides and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate, cover with foil to keep warm. 

Add remaining 1 tsp olive oil to saute pan then add garlic and saute 20 seconds, or just until lightly golden, then pour in chicken broth while scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan. 

Bring broth to a boil then add orzo pasta, reduce heat to medium cover pan with lid and allow to gently boil 5 minutes then uncover, stir and continue to boil uncovered until orzo is tender, about 5 minutes longer, stirring occasionally (don't worry if there's still a little broth, it will give it some saucy-ness).

Once pasta has cooked through toss chicken in with orzo then remove from heat. Add in parmesan cheese and stir until melted, then toss in sun dried tomatoes, basil and season with pepper (you shouldn't need any salt but add a little if you'd think it needs it). 

Add more broth to thin if desired (as the pasta rests it will soak up excess liquid and I liked it with a little excess so I added a little more). Serve warm.
