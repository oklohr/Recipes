[Slow Cooker Curried Butternut Squash Soup Recipe | Little Spice Jar](http://littlespicejar.com/curried-butternut-squash-soup-slow-cooker/)

## Ingredients
2 – 2 ¼ pounds butternut squash, chopped into small chunks
1 large yellow onion, diced
2 granny smith apples, diced
2 carrots, cut into chunks
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon curry powder (mild or hot and more to taste)
¼ teaspoon cinnamon powder
1 teaspoon fresh minced ginger
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 cups vegetables (or chicken) broth
½ cup heavy cream (plus more to thin soup to preference)

## Process
Spray a 7-8 quart slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray.

Add the butternut squash, onions, apples, carrots, sugar, salt, black pepper, bay leaves, curry powder, cinnamon, ginger, garlic, and vegetable broth.

Allow the soup to cook on the low heat setting for 7-8 hours or on the high heat setting for 4-5 hours.

The butternut squash is done when you can easily pierce it with a fork.

Using an immersion blender, or by pouring the soup in batches into a conventional blender, blend the soup. Make sure to hold the lid down with a towel if using a regular blender.

Stir in the cream and adjust the curry powder, broth, salt, and pepper to your liking. Serve warm with garlic toast or saltine crackers.
