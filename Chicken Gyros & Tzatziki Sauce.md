[Chicken Gyros & Tzatziki Sauce](https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/easy-chicken-gyros-tzatziki-sauce/)

## Ingredients
4 chicken breasts, pounded to 1/2 inch thickness
1 tablespoon mediterranean seasoning (you can substitute Italian seasoning in a pinch)
1 red pepper, thinly sliced
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
4 pitas (this is a Greek-style flatbread you can find at almost any grocery store near the bread and tortillas or in the bakery)
optional: lettuce, feta cheese crumbles
### Tzatziki Sauce
1/2 English cucumber, peeled and diced
2 cups cold plain Greek yogurt
4 teaspoons minced garlic
1/3 cup 1/3 cup chopped dill, fresh or frozen (may sub 2 tablespoons dried dill)
1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (juice of 1/2 medium lemon)
1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
1/8 teaspoon black pepper

## Process
Squeeze water out of cucumbers. Puree all sauce ingredients in a blender or food processor (see note below recipe first!). Cover and chill until ready to serve. (If you have time, make this a few hours in advance or the night before so that the flavors can marinate)

Season chicken breasts with mediterranean seasoning. Cook in a large skillet or pan over medium heat 5-6 minutes on each side until cooked through. Cut into strips.

Lay pitas on a clean surface. Add lettuce (if desired, chicken, red pepper strips, and onions. Top with tzatziki sauce and feta (if desired). Fold pita over like a sandwich, or roll it into a "tunnel shape".
