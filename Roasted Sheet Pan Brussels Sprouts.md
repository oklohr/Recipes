[Roasted Brussels Sprouts | Barefoot Contessa](https://barefootcontessa.com/recipes/roasted-brussels-sprouts)

## Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts
3 tablespoons good olive oil
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Process
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut off the ends of the Brussels sprouts and pull off any yellow outer leaves. Mix them in a bowl with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Turn them out on a baking sheet and roast for 35 to 40 minutes, until crisp outside and tender inside. Shake the pan from time to time, to brown the Brussels sprouts evenly. Sprinkle with more kosher salt (I like these salty like french fries) and serve.
