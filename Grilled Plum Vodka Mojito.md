## Ingredients
### Grilled Plums
3 large, ripe plums
2 tablespoons maple syrup

### Mojito
2 tablespoons fresh squeezed lime juice
1-ounce simple syrup
12 fresh mint leaves, plus more to garnish
1 cup ice
1/4 cup Hangar 1 Straight Vodka
3 tablespoons club soda
1 lime, cut into wedges

## Process
Heat a grill or griddle pan over medium heat. When hot, add the sliced plums to the grill and cook for 1 ½ to 2 minutes, until deep grill marks form. Flip the plums, and baste the tops of each wedge with maple syrup. Cook another 1 ½ minutes, until both sides of each wedge are nicely charred, then set aside.

Muddle the mint leaves, simple syrup, and lime juice in the bottom of a 10-ounce high ball glass. Add the ice to the glass, then pour in the Hangar 1 Straight Vodka and club soda. Add 2 or 3 grilled plums, a lime wedge, and give the lot a good stir. Garnish with fresh mint and serve immediately.
