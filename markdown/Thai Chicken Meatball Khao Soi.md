[Weeknight Thai Chicken Meatball Khao Soi. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/thai-chicken-meatball-khao-soi/)

## Ingredients
1 pound ground chicken
2 green onions, finely, chopped, plus more for serving
1 inch fresh ginger, grated
1 clove garlic, minced or grated
black pepper
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 baby bok choy or 1 bunch kale, chopped
1/4 cup Thai red curry paste
2 (14-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
3 tablespoons fish sauce (or low sodium soy sauce)
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 cup each fresh cilantro and Thai or regular basil, chopped, plus more for serving
8 ounces egg or rice noodles
sliced limes and thinly sliced shallots, for serving
chili oil, for serving

## Process
Add the chicken, green onions, ginger, garlic, and a pinch of pepper to a bowl. Mix until just combined. Coat your hands with a bit of oil, and roll the meat into tablespoon-size balls (will make 15-20 meatballs).

Heat a large pot over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons oil. When the oil shimmers, add the meatballs and sear until crisp, about 4-5 minutes, turning them 2-3 times. Toss in the bok choy and cook 2 minutes more, until just charred on the edges. Transfer everything to a plate.

To the same pot, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and the curry paste. Cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the coconut milk, chicken broth, fish sauce, and honey. Slide the meatballs and bok choy back into the soup. Simmer over medium heat until the meatballs are cooked through, 5-8 minutes. Stir in the herbs.

Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions.

Divide the noodles between bowls and ladle the soup over. Top each bowl as desired with basil, green onions, shallots, lime juice, and chili oil.
