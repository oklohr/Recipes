[Spumoni Slices Recipe | Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/spumoni-slices/)

## Ingredients
1 cup butter, softened
1-1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted
1/2 cup chopped pecans
3 to 5 drops green food coloring
1/4 cup finely chopped candied red cherries
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
3 to 5 drops red food coloring

## Process
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually add flour and mix well. Divide dough in three portions. Stir chocolate into one portion. Add pecans and green food coloring to the second portion. Add cherries, almond extract and red food coloring to the third.

Roll each portion between two pieces of waxed paper into an 8x6-in. rectangle. Remove waxed paper. Place chocolate rectangle on a piece of plastic wrap. Top with the green and pink rectangles; press together lightly. Wrap with plastic and chill overnight.

Cut chilled dough in half lengthwise. Return one rectangle to the refrigerator. Cut remaining rectangle into 1/8-in. slices. Place 1 in. apart on un-greased baking sheets.

Bake at 375Â° for 5-7 minutes or until set. Cool for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks. Repeat with remaining dough.
