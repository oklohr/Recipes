## Ingredients
### Fresh Fettuccine Pasta Dough
2 1/2 cups flour
4 eggs
water

### Creamy Tomato Sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
1 small onion finely diced
4 cloves garlic minced or grated
Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
1 (28 ounce) can San Marzano tomatoes crushed by hand
½ cup red wine
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup heavy cream
¼ cup fresh basil and parsley chopped
½ cup fresh parmesan grated plus more for serving

### Butter Poached Lobster and Shrimp
8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted butter
½ cup white wine
6 cloves garlic minced or grated
4 lobster tails meat removed from the shells
12 shrimp peeled + deveined
zest of 1 lemon
¼ cup fresh basil and parsley chopped
crushed red pepper flakes to taste

## Process
### To Make the Pasta
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, add the flour and eggs.

Knead the dough until it comes together and forms a ball. If your dough seems too dry, add water, a teaspoon at a time, being careful not to add too much water. If the dough becomes too sticky, just sprinkle in a little extra flour.

Quarter the dough and shape into four disks. Place the disks on a lightly floured board and cover with a damp kitchen towel or place in a gallon size Ziploc bag to keep it from drying out.

Flatten one dough piece at a time, and dust generously with flour, brushing off excess. Set your pasta machine to the widest setting; run the dough through. Fold the dough into thirds like a letter, then run it through again, short end first. Run it through 2 more times, dusting with flour if the dough gets sticky. Return the dough sheet to the floured board, cover with a towel and repeat with the remaining 3 dough disks. Keep any dough you are not working with covered with a damp kitchen towel or in the bag.

Roll all the dough sheets through the machine again 3-4 more times (machines vary), adjusting the machine up to the next setting each time. I roll my pasta sheets out to the fourth setting.

Now switch to the fettuccine pasta cutter attachment for your stand mixer, and roll each pasta sheet through the machine. Toss the noodles with a little flour to prevent them from sticking to each other and place the noodles in mounds on a flour dusted wood cutting block. Cover the pasta until ready to boil OR leave out for 1-2 days until completely dry and brittle to touch.

### To Make the Sauce, Lobster and Finish the Meal
Heat the olive oil and butter over medium-low heat in a large pot. Add the onion, garlic and chili flakes and cook for 5 minutes or until the garlic is fragrant. Watch the garlic carefully; if it burns it will become bitter and you’ll have to start over.

Stir in the tomatoes (crushing them with your hands as you add them), red wine, salt, pepper and heavy cream. Stir to combine and then cover and simmer for 20-30 minutes or until thickened slightly. Stir in the basil, parsley and parmesan.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil the fresh cut pasta for 3-4 minutes or until al dente, strain and toss with 1 teaspoon of olive oil.

To cook the lobster, heat 2 tablespoons water in a saucepan or brazier set over medium-low heat. Add 1 tablespoon of butter at a time until the entire stick has melted. Stir in the white wine and add the garlic, cook 30 seconds to 1 minute or until the garlic is fragrant.

Add the lobster and shrimp. Cook 3 minutes per side. Once the meat is white and cooked throughout, remove from the heat and add the parsley, basil and lemon zest.

Add the fresh pasta to the creamy tomato sauce and toss well to combine. Divide the pasta among pasta bowls and top each with the lobster and shrimp. You may drizzle the remaining butter sauce over the seafood and the pasta if preferred. Garnish with fresh herbs and parmesan.
