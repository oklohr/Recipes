[Pancetta Wrapped Pork Tenderloin. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/pancetta-wrapped-pork-tenderloin/)

## Ingredients
1 (4 pound) Smithfield Roasted Garlic & Herb Marinated Fresh Pork
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
kosher salt and pepper
7 ounces thinly sliced pancetta
2 large carrots chopped
1 large onion quartered
fresh thyme and rosemary

## Process
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Heat a large skillet over high heat. Rub the pork all over with 1 tablespoon olive oil, then sprinkle with thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Add the pork to the hot skillet and sear all over until browned, about three to five minutes per side. Remove the pork from a skillet and place on a roasting rack set inside a roasting pan.

Layer on the pancetta, overlapping the layers until the pancetta covers all but the bottom of the pork. Lightly brush the top of the pancetta with olive oil.

In a small bowl, toss together the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, the carrots and onion. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the veggies to the roasting pan with the pork.

Transfer the roasting pan to the oven and roast for 25-30 minutes or until pancetta is crispy and the pork is cooked through. Let the pork sit 5 minutes before slicing.
