## Ingredients
1 pound beef stew meat
2 cups spicy marinara or spaghetti sauce
3 cups vegetable broth
2 14.5oz cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes (or regular diced tomatoes if preferred)
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
8 oz dried tortellini pasta noodles
2 tablespoons heavy cream optional
grated parmesan cheese for serving optional

## Process
Add stew meat, spaghetti sauce, broth, diced tomatoes and Italian seasoning to slow cooker

Cover and cook on low for 7 - 9 hours

Remove lid and stir (you can also break up any larger chunks of stew meat if desired)

Add tortellini pasta and turn slow cooker to high, let cook for 20-30 minutes or until pasta is tender

To cut the acidity a bit you can stir in one to two tablespoons of cream, this is optional but does help the flavors work together nicely

Serve garnished with grated parmesan cheese or as desired
