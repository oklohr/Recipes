## Ingredients
2 (5.6-ounce) packages refrigerated Yaki-Soba, seasoning sauce packets discarded*
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/3 cup reduced sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
2 tablespoons honey
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
1 green onion, thinly sliced

## Process
In a large pot of boiling water, add Yaki-Soba until loosened, about 1-2 minutes; drain well.

In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and 1/4 cup water; set aside.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, add soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, honey and 1 cup water; bring to a simmer. Stir in cornstarch mixture until thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 2 minutes; let cool to room temperature. Reserve 1/4 cup and set aside.

In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine soy sauce mixture and chicken; marinate for at least 30 minutes to overnight, turning the bag occasionally. Drain the chicken from the marinade.

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 3-4 minutes; set aside.

Stir in Yaki-Soba and 1/4 cup reserved soy sauce mixture until well combined, about 2 minutes.
Serve immediately, garnished with sesame seeds and green onion, if desired.
