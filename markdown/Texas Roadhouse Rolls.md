## Ingredients
1 1/4 cups whole milk (105-110 degrees F)
1 (1/4-ounce) packet active dry yeast
3 tablespoons honey
1/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 large egg, at room temperature
1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

## Process
Combine milk, yeast and honey in a small bowl; let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with dough hook attachment, beat the milk mixture, butter, egg, salt and 2 cups flour on medium-low speed until a smooth batter forms, about 1-2 minutes.

Gradually add remaining 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a soft, smooth ball of dough is formed. The dough should feel elastic and slightly tacky to the touch. Increase speed to medium-high and beat for 3 minutes.

Lightly oil a large bowl or coat with nonstick spray; place dough in bowl, turning to coat. Cover with a clean dishtowel and let stand in a warm spot until dough has doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Gently deflate dough by punching down. Working on a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Fold in half, gently pressing the edges to seal. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough again into a 12Ã—8-inch rectangle; cut into 15 rolls.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place rolls onto the prepared baking sheets. Cover with a clean dishtowel and let stand in a warm spot until dough has doubled in size, about 30-45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place into oven and bake until golden brown, about 14-16 minutes.

Serve warm, brushed with butter, if desired.
