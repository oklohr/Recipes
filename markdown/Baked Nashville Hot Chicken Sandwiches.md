## Ingredients
### CHICKEN
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts pounded to ½ inch thickness
1½ cup buttermilk
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tsp turmeric
1 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
½ tsp black pepper

### HONEY HOT BUTTER
¾ cup unsalted butter (1½ sticks) melted and divided
¼ cup honey
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 tsp cayenne pepper
¼ tsp salt
4 burger buns lightly toasted
2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce
½ cup buttermilk ranch

## Process
Lightly season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper and place in a shallow baking dish.

Pour buttermilk over chicken, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 425˚F.

In a shallow baking dish combine flour, breadcrumbs, garlic powder, turmeric, smoked paprika, baking powder, salt, and pepper.

Remove chicken breasts from buttermilk, one at a time, and dredge them in the flour mixture until fully coated, shaking off any excess.

Transfer coated chicken to a well, greased cooling rack placed over a baking sheet, about 1 1/2 inches apart.

Spoon 1 tablespoon melted butter over each piece of chicken and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until coating has browned and the chicken has cooked through.

While chicken is baking, combine remaining 1/2 cup butter, honey, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt in a small mixing bowl and whisk together.

Once chicken is done baking, remove from oven and brush spicy-honey butter all over each piece until well coated.

To assemble: Spread ranch over the bottoms of each bun and top with a piece of honey hot chicken. Top chicken with a handful of shredded lettuce and more ranch. Place top buns over each sandwich and serve.
