## Ingredients
4 medium overly ripe bananas, mashed (about 1 1/4 cup mashed)
1/4 cup melted coconut oil
1/4 cup honey
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour, or all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup semi-sweet or dark chocolate chunks

## Process
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9x5 inch bread pan.

In a large mixing bowl, stir together the mashed bananas, coconut oil, honey, eggs, and vanilla until combined. Add the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt, mix until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chunks. 

Pour the batter into the prepared bread pan. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until center is just set. Remove and let cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting...or just eat it warm with a smear of butter and a drizzle of honey (you should do this!). Enjoy!
