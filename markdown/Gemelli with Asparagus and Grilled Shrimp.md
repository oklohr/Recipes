[Pasta with asparagus and grilled shrimp | white plate blank slate](http://whiteplateblankslate.com/pasta-asparagus-shrimp/)

## Ingredients
**For the sauce**
½ cup white wine
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 Tbsp. champagne or white wine vinegar
6 Tbsp. cold, unsalted butter, cut into 1 Tbsp. pieces

**For the shrimp and pasta**
1 lb. shrimp, peeled and deveined
10 oz. dried gemelli
½ lb fresh asparagus, cut into 1½-inch pieces
Freshly grated Parmesan cheese

## Process
To make the sauce, combine the wine, garlic and vinegar in a small pan and bring to a boil. Boil until reduced to about ¼ cup.

Remove from heat and whisk in the butter, one tablespoon at a time, so that it forms a thick sauce. Season to taste with salt. Pour about ¼ of the sauce into a small dish (this is for the shrimp).

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. (Set the sauce near the pasta pot so it stays warm but doesn't break)

Thread the shrimp onto skewers and heat a grill over high heat. Baste with some of the sauce.

Cook pasta according to package directions (usually about 10 minutes.) When 1 minute remains, add the asparagus.

While the pasta cooks, grill the shrimp, about 3 minutes per side, depending on the size of the shrimp. Baste with the reserved sauce as you go.

Drain the pasta and asparagus and put in a large bowl. Toss with the remaining sauce. Top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and the grilled shrimp.
