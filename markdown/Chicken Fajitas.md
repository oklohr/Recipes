[Slow Cooker Chicken Fajitas](http://www.cookingclassy.com/2015/01/slow-cooker-chicken-fajitas/)

## Ingredients
2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast halves
1 (14.5 oz) can petite diced tomatoes with green chilies
1 red , orange and green bell pepper, julienned
1 large yellow onion , halved and sliced
4 cloves garlic , minced
2 1/2 tsp chili powder
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp paprika
3/4 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp salt
3/4 tsp pepper
2 Tbsp fresh lime juice
1 Tbsp honey
For serving:
12 6-inch flour tortillas
Sour cream, cilantro, salsa, guacamole, Monterrey jack or cheddar cheese**

## Process
Pour half of the canned tomatoes into the bottom of a slow cooker and spread into an even layer. Top with half of the peppers and half of the onions. Sprinkle garlic in. Top with chicken breasts.

In a bowl whisk together chili powder, cumin, paprika, coriander, salt and pepper. Evenly sprinkle half of the seasoning over chicken breasts then flip chicken and sprinkle in remainder. Top with remaining half of the tomatoes, then layer in remaining peppers and onions.

Cover and cook on HIGH heat about 3 hours or low heat 5 - 6 hours*, until chicken has cooked through and veggies are tender (note that if you want to be able to cut chicken into strips cook more near lesser time on HIGH or LOW, otherwise it will probably just shred, which is also fine).

Remove chicken, and cut into strips, or shred. Ladle out 1 cup of the broth in slow cooker (mostly tomato liquid) and discard. 

In a small bowl whisk together lime juice and honey and add to slow cooker along with chicken and season with additional salt to taste if desired. Gently toss. Serve warm in warmed tortillas with sour cream and optional guacamole, cheese and salsa.

## Recipe Notes
Originally listed as 3 - 4 hours on high,  7 - 8 hours on low. Unless your slow cooker cooks really low they shouldn't need that much time.
