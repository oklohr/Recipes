## Ingredients
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 cups granulated sugar
1/2 cup canola oil
2 large eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
cinnamon sugar

## Process
Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease an 11″x 15″ baking pan.

Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter, sugar, oil, eggs, and milk. Mix in the vanilla.

Reduce mixer speed to low. Add the flour, salt, and baking soda, and mix well.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Spread evenly with an off-set spatula or knife. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.

Bake 20 minutes, or until the edges are light brown. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Then, cut into squares.

### Notes:
* To make cinnamon sugar, mix 1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon for every 1/4 cup granulated sugar.
