## Ingredients
### MACARON COOKIE SHELL
4 oz. confectioners sugar minus 2 tbsp
2 oz. almond flour I recommend Bob’s Red Mill
2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder Hershey’s is the best!
1 oz granulated sugar
2 oz. egg whites roughly two eggs at room temperature
1/4 tsp salt

### TOPPINGS
Melted peanut butter chips (about ¼ cup)

### BUTTERCREAM
1 stick butter at room temperature
1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar
½ cup smooth peanut butter
1 1/2 tsp heavy whipping cream
1 tsp vanilla extract.

## Process
Weigh out all of your ingredients. Sift together your almond flour, powdered sugar( remember to remove 2 tbsp and replace with 2 tbsp cocoa powder), and cocoa powder in a large bowl and set aside.

Add your egg whites to the bowl of your mixer and start mixing on a medium speed until they get frothy. Add in the salt.

Gradually add in your sugar to the egg whites and mix on a medium speed until you get a soft peak consistency. 

After the egg whites are the right consistency, add about 1/3 of the dry mixture to the egg whites and fold in until there are no dry spots left.

Add in the remaining dry mixture to the meringue and fold in until there are no dry spots. Begin to check for the “ribbon” stage, where the batter falls off in ribbons and you can make a figure 8 without it breaking off. Once you get to this consistency stop folding.

Prepare your piping bag with a small round tip. Place your bag in a large cup to make it easier to add your batter. Slowly add in your batter.

Place a silicon mat on a baking sheet. Hold your piping bag completely vertical when piping and lift straight up. Making about 1 1/2 to 2 inch circles.

After you have piped all the batter, bang the baking sheet on the counter 10-20 times (seriously) to remove all air bubbles. Use a toothpick or something sharp to pop them.

Now it is time to let them dry. Leave them sitting on the counter for 30-60 minutes until you can touch them and you can feel a “shell” form over them. No batter should come off on your finger. Preheat your oven to 300 degrees F. and bake your macarons for 15-18 minutes or until lightly browned. When you touch the top of the macaron it should not wiggle around on the “feet”. Allow them to cool COMPLETELY before taking them off the baking sheet.

Melt the peanut butter chips with about 1 tsp vegetable shortening and add to a ziplock bag, being careful not to burn yourself it will be warm.  Cut a small hole in one corner of the bag. Drizzle over the top of the macaron shells. Allow to harden before moving on to the filling. 

### To make the buttercream:
Place the butter and peanut butter in the bowl of your stand mixer with a paddle attachment and cream until light and fluffy. Add in the confectioners sugar and mix until combined. Add in the vanilla extract, and cream and mix until combined.

Place in a pipping bag with a star tip and set aside. Pipe a generous amount of buttercream on half of the macaron shells. Sandwich them with the remaining macaron shells.

Keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 24-48 hours to allow them to “mature”. Be sure to allow to come to room temperature before serving.
