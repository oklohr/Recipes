[Mini Hasselback Potatoes](https://damndelicious.net/2019/02/19/mini-hasselback-potatoes/) 

## Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds petite gold potatoes
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh basil leaves
1 tablespoon minced fresh chives
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves
1 clove garlic, finely grated

## Process
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Using a sharp knife, make crosswise cuts in each potato, about 1/8-inch apart, stopping about 1/4 inch from the bottom.

Place potatoes in a single layer, cut side up, onto the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Place into oven and bake until tender and crisp, about 45-50 minutes.

In a small bowl, combine remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil, basil, chives, parsley and garlic; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Serve potatoes immediately, drizzled with olive oil mixture.
