## Ingredients
1 1-pound package DeLallo Potato Gnocchi
 2 tablespoons butter
 1 clove garlic finely chopped
 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
 1 cup whole milk
 1/2 cup sour cream
 1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese divided
 Salt and black pepper to taste
 2 green onions chopped
 3 strips cooked bacon chopped

## Process
Preheat oven to 350ËšF. Spray a 9" x 9" baking dish with nonstick spray. Set aside.
Boil a pot of water and cook gnocchi according to package instructions. Drain and arrange in a single layer at the bottom of the prepared dish.

In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir in garlic and cook until lightly golden, about 1 minute. Whisk in flour until mixture thickens. Add the milk and whisk until the sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Whisk in 1 cup of the cheese. Whisk until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in the sour cream. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Pour sauce over gnocchi. Sprinkle remaining cheese, green onions, and bacon over the gnocchi.

Bake for 25 minutes, or until bubble and cheese is melted. Remove from oven and let sit for 5 minutes. Serve warm.
