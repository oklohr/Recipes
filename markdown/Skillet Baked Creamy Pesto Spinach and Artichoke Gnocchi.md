## Ingredients
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 medium sweet onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced or grated
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon fennel seed
1/4-1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
kosher salt and black pepper
1 pound uncooked potato gnocchi
3 cups fresh baby spinach or roughly torn kale
1/3 cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc
3/4 cup canned full fat coconut milk, heavy cream, or whole milk
1/3 cup basil pesto homemade or store-bought
1 jar (12 ounce) marinated, quartered artichokes, drained
1/2 cup shredded provolone or fontina cheese
zest and juice of 1 lemon
fresh basil, for serving

## Process
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet set over medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the onion, cooking until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, oregano, fennel seed, and crushed red pepper flakes, cooking until lightly golden, 2-3 minutes. Stir in the gnocchi, spinach or kale, wine, and 1 cup water. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cook 3-5 minutes, until the gnocchi is soft. Add the cream, pesto, and artichokes, cooking another 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Top with cheese.

Transfer to the oven and cook, uncovered for 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbling. Serve topped with lemon zest and juice, and basil, if desired.
