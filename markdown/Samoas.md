## Ingredients
1 stick (1/2 cup) salted butter, at room temperature
1/4 cup real maple syrup (or granulated sugar)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 cup real maple syrup
1/2 cup canned full fat coconut cream using only the coconut cream, no water
1 tablespoon creamy tahini, almond, or cashew butter
2 1/2 cups shredded unsweetened, toasted
12 ounces dark chocolate, chopped
flaky sea salt (optional)

## Process
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, cream together the butter, 1/4 cup maple syrup, and vanilla until light and fluffy, 3-5 minutes. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt, beat until combined and the dough begins to form a ball. If the dough is crumbly, add 1 tablespoon water until the dough comes together.

Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Make sure you're using enough flour or your dough will stick. Cut the cookies using a 3 inch circle cookie cutter. Using a 1 inch circle cookie cutter, cut out the center of each cookie. Transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheet. Roll out the leftover scraps, and repeat until all the dough has been used. Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes or until lightly golden. Cool on the baking sheet 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire cooling rack.

In a medium pot, combine 3/4 cup maple syrup and the coconut cream and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil 5-8 minutes or until thickened to a caramel-like sauce. Remove from the heat and stir in the tahini. Let the mix cool slightly, then stir in the toasted coconut. Press 1 tablespoon of the coconut mixture onto each cookie. Place the cookies in the freezer for 15-20 minutes to chill, this will make dipping them in chocolate easier.

Melt the chocolate. Dip the bottoms of the cookies in the chocolate and return to the parchment lined baking sheet. Use a fork to drizzle the tops with chocolate, return to the freezer to let the chocolate set up, about 10 minutes. Keep stored in the fridge or at room temperature for up to 1 week.

### RECIPE NOTES
Using Sweetened Coconut: If you are using sweetened coconut, omit the tahini from the recipe. The sweetened coconut thickens the sauce, so the tahini is not needed. For very best result, I would recommend using unsweetened coconut if you can. 

Tahini: if you don't have tahini or almond butter, you can leave this out. Your caramel will be a little looser, but still delicious.
