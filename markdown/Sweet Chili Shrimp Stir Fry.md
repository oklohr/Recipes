[Easy Sweet Chili Shrimp Stir Fry | Sweet Peas and Saffron](https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/easy-sweet-chili-shrimp-stir-fry/)

## Ingredients
2/3 cup uncooked rice
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 bell peppers sliced into strips
1 red onion sliced into strips
2 cups peas
12 oz uncooked shrimp thawed with tails removed (12-15 large shrimp)

### Stir Fry Sauce
6 tablespoons sweet chili sauce
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons water
2 teaspoons cornstarch

## Process
Shake together stir fry sauce and set aside.

In a medium non-stick pan, heat the oil over medium heat.

Add the bell peppers, onion and snap peas. Cook for 3-5 minutes, until slightly softened.
Remove veggies from the pan and place on a clean plate. Add more oil to the pan if necessary.

Add the shrimp to the pan, and cook for 3 or so more minutes, flipping halfway (cook time will depend on the size of your shrimp; make sure they are pink and firm and cooked through).

Give the stir fry sauce a good shake up and pour over the shrimp. Cook for 1 or so minutes until bubbling and thickened. Remove from heat and stir in the veggies.

Serve immediately or portion out into 2 cup capacity storage containers and store in the fridge.
