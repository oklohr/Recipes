## Ingredients
4 slices thick cut bacon, chopped
1 14 ounce can chopped tomatoes
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon red pepper
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 pound gnocchi
4 ounces baby spinach (about 5 cups)
Parmesan cheese, grated

## Process
Cook bacon in a large deep skillet over medium high heat until done to your liking. Add tomatoes, sugar, pepper, and vinegar and saute for about five minutes.

Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and add gnocchi. Cook according to package directions until gnocchi are done (usually when they float to the top).

Add spinach to gnocchi and cook for about 30 seconds until wilted. Drain gnocchi and spinach mixture and add to sauce.

Gently toss with tongs until combined. Divide among plates and top with Parmesan.
