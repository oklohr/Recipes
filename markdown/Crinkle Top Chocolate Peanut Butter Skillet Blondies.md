[Crinkle Top Chocolate Peanut Butter Skillet Blondies. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/chocolate-peanut-butter-skillet-blondies/#bo-recipe)

## Ingredients
2 sticks (1 cup) salted butter
3/4 cup creamy peanut butter
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 large eggs, at room temperature
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips
2-3 ounces dark chocolate chunks (or just handful more of chocolate chips)
flaky sea salt (optional)

## Process
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 

Add the butter to a 10-12 inch oven safe skillet set over medium heat. Allow the butter to brown lightly until it smells toasted, about 2-3 minutes. Stir often. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/2 cup peanut butter, the sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla. Let this cool until no longer hot, about 10-15 minutes. 

In a small bowl whisk the eggs for 2 minutes until bubbly on top. Stir the eggs into the peanut butter mix. Add the flour and baking powder. Gently stir in the chocolate chips and swirl the remaining 1/4 cup peanut butter into the dough, don't worry about making it perfect. Push the chocolate chunks into the dough. 

Transfer to the skillet oven and bake for 22-25 minutes, just until set around the edges, but gooey in the center. Remove from the oven, let cool 3-5 minutes. Sprinkle with sea salt (if desired). DIG in, preferably with a scoop of ice cream.

### RECIPE NOTES
