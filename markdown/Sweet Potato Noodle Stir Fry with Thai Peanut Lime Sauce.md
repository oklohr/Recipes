## Ingredients
### Marinade
1 tablespoon each: soy sauce, Thai red curry paste, oil
Juice from 1/2 lime

### Sweet Potato Noodle Stirfry
4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs or 1 package firm tofu, cut into cubes
1 teaspoon oil
2 red bell pepper, sliced
2 cups shredded red cabbage
2 medium sweet potatoes (about 1 lb. total), peeled and spiralized (this is the spiralizer I use)
1/2 cup each: cilantro and Thai basil

### Sauce
2/3 cup water
1/3 cup peanut butter
2 tablespoons each: rice vinegar and soy sauce (gluten-free if needed, sub coco aminos for paleo)
1 tablespoon honey (sub maple syrup for vegan)
1 teaspoon each: sriracha and fish sauce (omit for vegan)
2 garlic cloves
1 â€“ 1-inch piece ginger
Juice from 1 lime
A small handful of cilantro

## Process
Place the marinade ingredients into a large resealable plastic bag and squish the bag to mix them together. Place the chicken or tofu into the marinade and gently shake the bag so that everything is covered. Place the bag in your fridge and let it marinate for 30 minutes or up to 8 hours.

Set your oven to 400 degrees. Place the chicken or tofu and all the marinade in a baking dish and pop it into your oven. (No need to wait for your oven to completely preheat.) Cook for 20-25 minutes, with the option to broil for the last 5 minutes to help brown the chicken or tofu.

While the chicken or tofu is cooking, prepare the rest of the meal. Add all the sauce ingredients in your blender and blend on high until smooth. For a less smooth sauce, you can mince the garlic, ginger, and cilantro and whisk all the ingredients in a bowl. The sauce will be runny.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bell pepper and cabbage and stir-fry for about 3 minutes, or until they just begin to soften. Add the sweet potato noodles to the skillet and stir-fry, carefully turning them as they cook, for about 5 minutes. You want the noodles to have a slight crunch to them, but not so much that you feel you're eating raw potatoes.

Pour the sauce into the pan and sprinkle the cilantro and Thai basil over the top. Toss gently. The sauce will quickly thicken in the heat.
