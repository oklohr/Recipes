## Ingredients
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 tbsp sriracha, or your favourite hot sauce
1 chicken breast - about half a pound (mine was about 9 oz)
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp mustard powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp cayenne
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
canola or corn oil -enough to come up 1.5-2 inches up side of pot
buns
mayo
shredded lettuce

## Process
Cut chicken in half length wise.

Mix sriracha (or hot sauce) with buttermilk. Place chicken in buttermilk mixture and place in fridge for an hour.

In a bowl mix together flour and all spices. Stir to combine. After an hour remove chicken breast pieces and shake off excess buttermilk.

Dredge chicken breast pieces in flour mixture, shaking off excess. 

Dunk chicken pieces again in buttermilk, shaking off excess.  Dredge again in flour mixture, shaking off excess.

In a large pot with high sides (I used a high sided cast iron pot) or large dutch oven, add oil (enough to come up 1.5-2 inches up side of pot).  You want a temperature of about 350 F.  
I heated the oil to about 360 F as the temperature will drop when the chicken is added.
Carefully place chicken pieces in hot oil and cook about 3 minutes per side or until cooked through and juices run clear. Note: Depending on thickness of piece of chicken, may have to cook longer.  See notes below.

To assemble crispy chicken burgers spread mayo on buns, top with chicken and garnished with shredded lettuce.  Enjoy!

### Notes
Use a large heavy pot or dutch oven with high sides for frying the chicken.  Know what you're doing and always use caution when frying.

Always place the chicken in the oil away from you so if there are any splashes it's not going towards you. And gently drop the chicken into the oil..

The chicken breast I used was about 8 ounces (or half a pound).  If your chicken breast is larger or on the thicker side, you may have to cook a little longer.  Chicken is cooked when it reaches 165 F at the thickest part and the juices run clear.  If the juices are pink, then it's not done and ain't nobody got time for that. Continue cooking.

Speaking of cooking, a thermometer is your best friend here.  Use one to get the oil up to temperature (I like one with a pot clip so I can monitor the oil temp). Use a small food thermometer to prick the chicken and check for doneness. They're well worth the investment (and only about $20 and $10, respectively).

I love using a soft (untoasted) bun. Prefer to have it toasted? Go for it!
