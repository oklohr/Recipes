[Skillet Banana Nut Bread](http://www.themeaningofpie.com/2012/04/skillet-banana-nut-bread/)

## Ingredients
½ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
⅓ cup buttermilk
3 mashed bananas (over-ripe)
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cups all purpose flour
½ cup granulated sugar
½ cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped pecans
¼ teaspoon ground mace (may substitute nutmeg)
¼ teaspoon allspice
1 tablespoon unsalted butter (for greasing the skillet)

## Process
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a medium bowl, mash the peeled bananas with a fork. Mix in the buttermilk, melted butter, vanilla and finally the eggs. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine all of the dry ingredients and mix them to thoroughly combine. In two additions, mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined and no more. Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula to ensure that all of the flour mixture is mixed in.

Prepare a 9” cast iron skillet (measured across the bottom), by thoroughly greasing it with butter. Pour the batter into the cast iron skillet and spread it evenly with a rubber spatula. Place the cast iron skillet in the oven and bake for approximately 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the bread comes out clean. (Mine took exactly 33 minutes).
