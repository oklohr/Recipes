[Grandma’s Raspberry Rugelach Recipe | Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/grandma-s-raspberry-rugelach/)

## Ingredients
1-1/2 cups margarine, softened
1/3 cup sugar
3 teaspoons vanilla extract
Pinch salt
1 cup heavy whipping cream
4 to 4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup seedless raspberry jam

### OPTIONAL GLAZE:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
4 teaspoons 2% milk

## Process
In a large bowl, beat margarine, sugar, vanilla and salt on medium-low until combined. Slowly beat in whipping cream. Gradually beat in enough flour until dough is no longer sticky. Divide dough into four portions, then flatten into disks. Wrap in plastic; refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 350°. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion of dough into a 12-in. circle; spread each with 1/4 cup raspberry jam. Cut each circle into 16 wedges.

Gently roll up wedges from the wide ends. Place 2 in. apart on parchment-lined baking sheets, point side down. Bake 25-30 minutes or until light golden. Remove to wire racks to cool.

If desired, combine confectioners' sugar and milk until smooth. Drizzle over cooled rugelach.

### Notes
You can substitute apricot filling for the raspberry jam. In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon. Spread 1/4 cup apricot jam over dough; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar. Proceed as directed.
