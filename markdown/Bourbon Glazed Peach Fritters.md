## Ingredients
oil for frying
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
2 eggs
4 tablespoons unsalted butter melted
1 cup buttermilk
2-3 cups peaches chopped (about 2 1/2 chopped)
1/2 cup raw pecans chopped

### BOURBON MAPLE GLAZE
1/4 cup real maple syrup
6 tablespoons powdered sugar
1 tablespoon bourbon optional
1 teaspoon vanilla
whipped cream for serving

## Process
Fill a medium heavy bottom pot with oil and heat to 350 degrees F.

In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Add the eggs, butter and buttermilk and mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix the batter. Stir in the peaches and pecans.

Once the oil is hot, drop rounded tablespoons of batter into the oil. Fry on one side for 30 to 60 seconds or until golden brown, then flip the fritter and fry the other side for 30 to 60 seconds or until golden brown. Remove fritters from the oil with a spider or slotted spoon. Drain on a paper towel lined plate. Repeat with the remaining fritters.

To make the glaze, whisk together the maple syrup, powdered sugar, bourbon and vanilla. Drizzle the glaze over the warm fritters and EAT!
