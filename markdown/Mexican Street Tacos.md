## Ingredients
2 tablespoons reduced sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 1/2 pounds skirt steak, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
12 mini flour tortillas
3/4 cup diced red onion
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
1 lime, cut into wedges

## Process
In  a medium bowl, combine soy sauce, lime juice, 1 tablespoon canola oil, garlic, chili powder, cumin and oregano.

In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine soy sauce mixture and steak; marinate for at least 1 hour up to 4 hours, turning the bag occasionally.

Heat remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add steak and marinade, and cook, stirring often, until steak has browned and marinade has reduced, about 5-6 minutes, or until desired doneness.

Serve steak in tortillas, topped with onion, cilantro and lime.
