## Ingredients
1 cup butter
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
3 ounces semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
4 eggs, lightly beaten
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

## Process
Line a 13x9x2-inch baking pan with heavy foil, extending foil over edges of the pan. Butter the foil; set pan aside.

In a heavy large saucepan, heat 1 cup butter and chocolates over low heat, stirring constantly, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Set aside to cool slightly. In a medium bowl, stir together eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla. Stir into warm chocolate mixture; cool to room temperature.

In a small bowl, stir together flour, baking powder and salt. Fold flour mixture into chocolate mixture. Spread the batter in the prepared pan.

Bake in a 350 degrees oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until brownies appear shiny, begin to crack on top and appear set. (Do not overbake.) Cool completely in pan on a wire rack; then cut into bars. (For cleaner cuts, you can chill brownies in pan in refrigerator for several hours. Use foil to lift chilled brownies out of pan before cutting.)

## Variation: Triple Coffee Brownies
In Step 2, add 1/4 cup coffee liqueur (such as Kahlua) or strong brewed coffee to the eggs, sugars and vanilla. Continue recipe and bake as directed. For glaze: Stir coffee liqueur or strong brewed coffee, 1 teaspoon at a time, into 1 cup of powdered sugar, to reach drizzling consistency. Drizzle over cooled brownies. Garnish with chopped chocolate-covered espresso beans.

## Variation: Macaroon Brownies
In a small bowl, stir together 2 cups shredded coconut and one 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk. Dollop coconut mixture on brownie batter in pan. Bake as directed.

## Variation: Trail Mix Brownies
Sprinkle about 1 1/2 cups trail mix ingredients (such as salted peanuts, pretzel sticks, dried cranberries, raisins, chocolate pieces and/or candy-coated milk chocolate pieces) over brownie batter in pan. Bake as directed.

## Variation: Marbled Cream-Cheese Brownies
In a mixing bowl, beat together 4 ounces softened cream cheese, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla until smooth. Dollop mixture over brownie batter in pan. Swirl with the tip of a table knife, then bake as directed.

## Variation: Raspberry-Hazelnut Swirl Brownies
Add 1 cup chopped toasted hazelnuts to brownie batter. In a small bowl, stir 3/4 cup seedless raspberry preserves until smooth. Spoon preserves over brownie batter in pan. Swirl with the tip of a table knife, then bake as directed.
