 [Brie Stuffed Crispy Baby Potatoes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/brie-stuffed-crispy-baby-potatoes/) 

## Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds mixed baby potatoes
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
kosher salt and pepper
3 tablespoons butter, melted
2 cloves garlic, grated
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
8 ounces brie, cut into small wedges
1-2 teaspoons white truffle oil
8 pan-fried sage leaves
crushed pink peppercorn

## Process
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

On a large baking sheet, toss together the potatoes, olive oil and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven and roast 20 minutes or until the potatoes are fork tender. Using a potato masher or a fork, gently press down on the potatoes, smashing them to about 1/4 inch thickness.

Mix together the butter, garlic, and thyme. Drizzle the butter over the potatoes and return the potatoes to the oven and roast another 20-25 minutes or until golden and crisp. During the last 5 minutes of cooking, add a thin slice of brie to each potato and roast until melted. 

Arrange the warm potatoes on a serving plate and drizzle with truffle oil. Top with sage and peppercorns. Enjoy!
