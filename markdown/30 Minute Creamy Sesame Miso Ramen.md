1/4 cup tahini (sesame seed paste)
3 tablespoons white miso paste
2 tablespoons hot chili oil
1/4 cup dried porcini mushrooms (optional, but recommended)
1 inch fresh ginger, grated
2 cloves garlic, minced or grated
2-4 squares ramen noodles
4 cups shredded kale or baby spinach
4 tablespoons salted butter, melted or olive oil
2 pounds mixed mushrooms, roughly torn
2 small shallots, sliced
2 tablespoons raw sesame seeds
1/2 teaspoon chili flakes use more or less, to taste
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
4-6 soft or hard boiled eggs, for serving
sliced carrots and green onions, for serving

## Process
### STOVE-TOP
In a large soup pot, combine the broth, 2 cups water, soy sauce, vinegar, tahini, miso, and chili oil. Add the dried mushrooms (if using), ginger, and garlic. Set over medium heat on the stove and bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer 20 minutes, until the broth is very fragrant.

Remove and discard the mushrooms. Bring the soup to a boil over high heat. Stir in the noodles, kale or spinach, and cilantro. Let sit 5 minutes or until the noodles are soft.

Meanwhile, make the mushrooms. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. On a baking sheet, combine the butter, mushrooms, shallots, sesame seeds, chili flakes, and a pinch of salt. Transfer to the oven and roast for 15 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking, until the mushrooms are golden. Switch the oven to broil, broil 1-2 minutes, until crisp. Watch closely.

Ladle the soup into bowls and top with the crispy mushrooms, eggs, carrots, green onions, and additional chili oil. Enjoy!

### INSTANT POT
In the bowl of the instant pot, combine the broth, 2 cups water, soy sauce, vinegar, tahini, miso, and chili oil. Add the dried mushrooms (if using), ginger, and garlic. Cover and cook on high pressure for 8 minutes.

Once done cooking, use the natural or quick release function and release the steam. Remove and discard the mushrooms. Set the Instant pot to saut√©. Stir in the noodles, kale or spinach, and cilantro. Let sit 5 minutes or until the noodles are soft.

Finish as directed above for the stove-top.

### SLOW COOKER
In the bowl of the slow cooker, combine the broth, 2 cups water, soy sauce, vinegar, tahini, miso, and chili oil. Add the dried mushrooms (if using), ginger, and garlic. Cover and cook on high for 3-4 hours or low for 6-8 hours.

Once done cooking, switch the slow cooker to high. Remove and discard the mushrooms. Stir in the noodles, kale or spinach, and cilantro. Let sit 10-15 minutes or until the noodles are soft.

Finish as directed above for the stove-top.

### RECIPE NOTES
Leftovers: I recommend storing the soup and noodles separately, then adding the noodles just before serving. If you let the noodles sit in the soup, they will soak up all the broth and become very mushy.
