[Ireland Tradition: A Cast Iron Irish Apple Cake - 31 Daily](https://www.31daily.com/cast-iron-irish-apple-cake/)

## Ingredients
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
8 tablespoons butter (1 stick)
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
medium apple, sliced thinly (about 1 cup)
1 tablespoon sugar
Dash of ground cloves and a dash of cinnamon

## Process
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 10-inch cast iron skillet with parchment paper. Set aside.

In a medium-size bowl, Add the flour and baking powder. Cut in 1 stick, 8 tablespoons of butter, into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg into the flour and butter mixture.

Make a well in the center of the bowl and add the beaten egg, milk, and vanilla. Mix until a soft dough forms. Almost scone-like.

Spoon and press dough into the bottom of the parchment-lined skillet. Layer thinly sliced apples over the dough. Combine 1 tablespoon of sugar and a dash each of ground cloves and cinnamon. Sprinkle over the apples.

Place the skillet on the middle rack of your oven. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Then, switch the oven to broil. Keep the apple cake in the oven and broil, on the middle rack, 2-3 minutes or until the edges of the cake are golden brown. This step is optional… but I love the added crispness.

Allow the cake to cool slightly, cut into wedges and dust with powdered sugar. Or serve with whipped cream — or ice cream — all of which makes a delightfully delicious topping to this Irish Apple Cake!
