 [One Pot Creamy French Onion Pasta Bake](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/one-pot-creamy-french-onion-pasta-bake/) 

## Ingredients
4 tablespoons butter
2-3 sweet onions I like to use 2 smaller onions
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce omit if vegetarian
1 cup red wine
8 ounces button mushrooms sliced
salt + pepper to taste
2 cloves garlic minced or grated
3 cups low sodium chicken broth + 3/4 cups water
1 pound of your favorite short cut pasta use gluten free if needed
2 leaves bay
2-3 fresh thyme sprigs
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
pinch of cayenne pepper
6 ounces gruyere cheese shredded
1/3 cup gorgonzola cheese crumbled (optional)

## Process
Heat a large high-sided dutch oven over medium-high heat and add the butter. Add the onions + brown sugar and cook about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until softened. At this point you want to slowly add the Worcestershire sauce and the wine, let them cook into the onions, add more and continue to cook. Do this until the the wine is gone or the onions are caramelized to your liking. Make sure the wine has evaporated.

Preheat the the broiler to high.

Toss the mushroom and garlic in with the caramelized onions, season with salt + pepper, cook another 3-4 minutes or until the mushrooms are soft.

Pour in the chicken broth + water and bring to a boil. Add your pasta, bay leaves and thyme, cook, stirring often until most of the liquid has been soaked up by the pasta and the pasta is al dente. If you feel your pasta needs more water to continue cooking, add around 1/2 cup.

Stir in the cream and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Stir in half the gruyere cheese and the gorgonzola cheese. Cook 2 minutes and then remove from the heat. Top with the remaining cheese and place under the broiler for 1-2 minutes until the cheese is melted.
Serve warm, top with fresh thyme and parsley if desired.
