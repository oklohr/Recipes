## Ingredients
1 whole large jalapeno, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons fresh cilantro
16 oz light sour cream
1 oz package of ranch dressing mix
Â½ lime, juiced
4-6 tablespoons milk

## Process
Combine jalapeno, garlic, and cilantro in blender or food processor. Pulse until finely chopped.

Add light sour cream, ranch dressing mix, and lime juice and pulse to combine.

Add milk and pulse. You can add it slowly to get the consistency you want. The Chuy's version is pretty thin, so I liked 6 tablespoons.

Refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to combine, though it's pretty amazing right from the start, too.
