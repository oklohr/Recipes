[Better Than Takeout Sesame Ginger Chicken Fried Rice. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/chicken-fried-rice/)

## Ingredients
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce (make sure to use GF, if needed)
1-2 teaspoon chili flakes use to your taste
3 eggs, beaten (optional)
5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or sesame oil
Kosher salt and black pepper
2 cups shiitake or cremini mushrooms, roughly torn
4 baby bok choy or 2 cups spinach, roughly chopped
4 green onions, chopped
2 inches fresh ginger, grated
4 garlic cloves, minced or grated
1/2 pound chicken breasts, cubed
4 cups cooked, day-old rice
Â½ cup fresh basil or cilantro, chopped

## Process
To make the sauce. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, hoisin sauce, and chili flakes.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the eggs (if using), season with salt and pepper, and let cook until the edges start to set, 1-2 minutes. Roughly scramble the eggs. Remove from the heat and transfer to a plate.

Return the skillet to medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil. When the oil shimmers add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are crisping on the edges, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and large pinch of pepper. Stir in the green onions, ginger, garlic, and bok choy. Cook another 2-3 minutes, until the mushrooms are caramelized. Remove from the heat and transfer the mushrooms and greens to the plate with the eggs.

Return the skillet to medium-high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add the chicken and cook until browned, 5 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the sauce, cook another 1-2 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until toasted, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining sauce, toss, cook another 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the mushroom, bok choy, and eggs. Remove from the heat. Add the basil or cilantro.

Divide the rice amoung bowls and top with additional green onions.

### RECIPE NOTES
Homemade Hoisin: in a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce, 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter, 2 tablespoons honey, 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, 1 tablespoon molasses, 1 teaspoon Chinese 5 spice powder, and a pinch of black pepper. 

Cooking the Rice: 2 cups of dry jasmine or basmati rice yields 2 cups cooked rice. Make sure your rice is room temp and not hot before using. If you're cooking your rice just before making this recipe, cook the rice, then spread it out on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Transfer the baking sheet full of rice to the freezer and freeze for fifteen to twenty minutes to help the rice dry out. 

Brown Rice: works just a well and is a delicious, healthy twist! Quinoa works too, though I prefer brown rice.
