[Fluffy Gnocchi or Lazy Pierogies - Let the Baking Begin](https://letthebakingbegin.com/fluffy-gnocchi-or-lazy-pierogies/)

## Ingredients
3 lb medium sized yellow potatoes boiled with skin on until easily pierced with a fork, 			drained
2 cups all purpose flower
1 egg, large
2 tsp  kosher salt
1 tsp  garlic powder
1 tsp  black ground pepper
1/3 – 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese optional

### To Serve
1/2 - 1 lb bacon chopped into dice or strips
1 large onion finely diced
1/4 - 1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley or dill
2-3 Tbsp  butter
1 clove garlic pressed or minced

## Process
Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle peel the skin.

Using a potato ricer or a potato masher, rice or mash the potatoes while still warm (it’s much easier to do when the potatoes are warm). You can let the riced potatoes cool as you work on the bacon & the caramelized onion.

Dice or slice the bacon and render the fat until the bacon is crispy. Add diced onions and allow them to golden up as well. If you don’t like the taste of raw garlic add the minced garlic about 30 seconds before the onions are done browning. Now tilt the skillet to one side and bring all bacon and onions to the raised part, letting all fat to collect at the bottom. Remove the fat and discard. Reserve the bacon & onion until needed.

Now that the potatoes are somewhat cool, add the flour, egg, salt and pepper (and Parmesan cheese, if using) and with minimal amount of mixing bring everything into a dough like consistency. Mixing too long will make your gnocchi gummy.

Tear a baseball sized piece, roll into a ball and on a well floured surface roll into 1 inch rope. With a knife, cut the dough rope into 1/2 inch pieces and transfer to a well floured surface. Continue working on the rest of the dough. Use a fork or the gnocchi board to make the groves on each gnocchi if desired.

Fill a large pasta pot with water, salt it liberally until the water is as salty as seawater. Bring it to a rolling boil over high heat. Drop the gnocchi into the water, stir and let them rise to the top. Once they rise to the top, cook for about 30 seconds to 1 minute and remove with a slotted spoon to an ice bath to stop the cooking process.

Then quickly transfer to a bowl with some bacon, caramelized onion, parsley or dill (if using) and a dab of butter or a tablespoon or two of olive oil. If you don’t mind the smell of fresh garlic add it to the bowl and toss everything together to prevent gnocchi from sticking to each other.

Serve with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkling of black ground pepper.
