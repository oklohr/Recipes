1 tablespoon hot sauce
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined

## Process
To make the slaw, combine cabbage, sour cream, mayonnaise, cilantro, garlic, lime juice and salt in a large bowl; set aside.

To make the sauce, whisk together mayonnaise, sweet chili sauce, honey and Frank’s Hot Sauce in a small bowl; set aside.

Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.

Working one at a time, dip shrimp into buttermilk mixture, then dredge in Panko, pressing to coat.

Working in batches, add shrimp to the skillet and cook until evenly golden and crispy, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
