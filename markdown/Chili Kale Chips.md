## Ingredients
1 bunch kale, ribs removed and torn into pieces
1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons chili powder
Salt

## Process
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In a bowl, combine the kale and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Use your fingers to massage the oil into the kale. If it seems dry, add more oil. Season with chili powder and salt and toss to coat.

Spread the kale onto 2 baking sheets. Bake until the chips look crisp, 10 to 15 minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through.
