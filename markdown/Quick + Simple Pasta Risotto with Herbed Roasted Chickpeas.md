## Ingredients
### HERBED CHICKPEAS
1 (14 ounce) can chickpeas drained + rinsed
1 head cauliflower cut into florets (can sub broccoli if preferred), I used green Cauliflower
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt + pepper
1 cup mixed fresh herbs (I use basil parsley, dill + oregano)

### QUICK PASTA "RISOTTO"
2 tablespoons butter use vegan butter for vegan version
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 small sweet onion chopped
4 cloves garlic left whole
1 cup dry white wine
1 pound short cut pasta
5 1/2 cups chicken or veggies broth (I prefer to use chicken broth but use veggie for a veggie version)
3/4 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese + more for topping use vegan parmesan or nutritional yeast for vegan version
1/2 cup fresh basil + more for topping
2 cups fresh baby kale
4-5 poached or hard boil eggs optional

## Process
### HERBED CHICKPEAS
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Spread the chickpeas out on a towel and dry them completely. Add the chickpeas + cauliflower to a baking sheet and toss with the olive oil, salt + pepper. Toss well to evenly coat. Roast for 20 minutes and then stir the chickpeas/cauliflower around and roast another 20 minutes or until the chickpeas are golden. Remove from the oven and toss with the fresh herbs. Serve warm atop the pasta. Save any leftovers for snacking later!

### QUICK PASTA "RISOTTO"
Heat a large pot over medium heat and add the olive oil + butter. Once hot, add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring ofter until the onion + garlic cloves are soft and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Slowly pour in the wine and bring to a simmer, simmer until the wine is reduced by half. Add the pasta and 2 cups of broth. Cook, stirring often until the broth is mostly absorbed. Add another 2 cups of broth and do the same as above, cooking until most of the pasta has absorbed the broth. Continue this process until the pasta is al dente and there is around 1 cup of broth left in the pot. Once the pasta is al dente, remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the parmesan, crushed red pepper flakes + basil. Taste and season as needed with salt + pepper.

Remove the cloves of garlic from the risotto. Stir the cauliflower florets into the risotto. Divide the risotto among bowls and top with a handful of baby kale, a poached egg and the roasted chickpeas. Garnish with more parmesan + basil. EAT!
