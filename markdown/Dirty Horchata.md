## Ingredients
1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
1/3 cup honey or real maple syrup
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon plus more for serving
4 cups canned coconut milk or whole milk
1 cup cold coffee or espresso
2-8 ounces dark rum or Kahl√∫a (optional)
cinnamon sugar, for rimming (optional)

## Process
Combine the rice and 2 1/2 cups steaming hot water in a large bowl. Soak at room temperature for 2 hours, the rice will not be completely soft, this is OK. Alternately, you can use room temp water and soak for 8 hours or overnight. (see notes for additional methods).

Pour the rice and water into a blender. Blend until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the honey or maple syrup, vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Blend until combined. Pour the mixture into a large pitcher or jar. Add the milk and stir to combine. Chill until ready to serve. Stir well before serving.

To serve, rim each glass with cinnamon sugar, if desired. Fill glasses with ice. Add the horchata, then pour over the coffee, using an amount to your liking. Add the Kahlua, if using, and stir to combine. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Enjoy!

### RECIPE NOTES
Storing: the Horchata base will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.

Straining: If a smoother consistency is desired, you can strain the horchata through a cheesecloth lined sieve, then chill. I personally do not find the need to do this.

Quick Cook: Bring 2 1/2 cups water a boil, add the rice, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 25 minutes. Cool, then finish as directed. 

Rice Not Getting Soft: the water should be boiling and it needs to sit at least 2 hours to become soft.
