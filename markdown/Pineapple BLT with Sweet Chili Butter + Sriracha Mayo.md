 [Pineapple BLT with Sweet Chili Butter + Sriracha Mayo](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/pineapple-blt-with-sweet-chili-butter-sriracha-mayo/) 

## Ingredients
### Sriracha Mayo
1/4 cup tahini
2 tablespoons plain greek yogurt
1-2 tablespoons sriracha

### SWEET CHILI BUTTER
4 tablespoons butter softened
1-2 tablespoons Thai sweet chili sauce

### PINEAPPLE BLT
4 fresh pineapple rounds cored
8 slices sourdough bread
4 leaves butter lettuce
1-2 heirloom or regular tomatoes sliced
salt + pepper to taste
8 slices cooked bacon
1 avocado sliced
4 fried eggs optional

## Process
### SRIRACHA "MAYO"
Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and whisk until smooth. Add 1 tablespoon water at a time until your desired "mayo" like consistency is reached. Keep stored, covered in the fridge until ready to serve or up to 1 week.

### SWEET CHILI BUTTER
Stir together the butter and chili sauce until combined.

### BLT
Heat a skillet, grill pan or grill to high heat. Sear the pineapple slices on bother sides until caramelized, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove and place on a plate.

Using the sweet chili butter, butter both sides of each slices of bread and place the bread on the grill/skillet. Cook until LIGHTLY toasted, about 1-2 minutes per side. Don't over toast the bread as you want it crusty on the edges and soft in the middle.

To assemble, spread a little sriracha mayo over each piece of bread. Layer on the lettuce, tomatoes (season the tomatoes with salt + pepper), bacon, pineapple and avocado. If desired. Add a fried egg. Add the top piece of bread. Give the sandwich a little smoosh down to adhere....EAT!
