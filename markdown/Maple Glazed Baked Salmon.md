[Maple Glazed Baked Salmon. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/maple-glazed-baked-salmon/)

## Ingredients
4 salmon fillets
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup orange juice
1/4-1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
kosher salt and black pepper
1/2 pound brussels sprouts halved
2 pears or apples quartered
2 tablespoons olive oil
pomegranate arils for garnish (optional)

## Process
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

In a 9x13 inch baking dish, whisk together the maple, soy sauce, orange juice, cayenne, and pepper. Place the salmon flesh side down in the maple sauce. Let sit 15 minutes.

On a baking sheet, combine the brussels sprouts, pears, olive oil, salt and pepper. Toss well to evenly coat. Place in the oven and roast for 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, remove the salmon from the maple sauce and add to the baking sheet with the brussels sprouts and pears. Transfer to the oven and roast for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the salmon has reached your desired doneness.

Meanwhile, pour the remaining maple sauce into a small sauce pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook for 3-5 minutes or until the sauce has reduced into a glaze.

Drizzle the glaze over the salmon and serve with a side of the roasted brussels sprouts and pears...
