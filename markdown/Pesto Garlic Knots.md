[Pesto Garlic Knots](https://damndelicious.net/2018/02/09/pesto-garlic-knots/) 

## Ingredients
1 cup basil leaves
1/2 cup parsley leaves
4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan, divided
2 cloves garlic, minced
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound pizza dough, homemade or store-bought, at room temperature
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

## Process
To make the pesto, combine basil, parsley, 3 tablespoons Parmesan and garlic in the bowl of a food processor; season with salt and pepper, to taste. With the motor running, add olive oil in a slow stream until emulsified; set aside.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray.
Cut dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 6-inch rope, about 1/2-inch thick, and tie into a knot, tucking the ends.

Place knots onto the prepared baking sheet and brush each knot with butter; sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Place into oven and bake until golden brown, about 18-22 minutes.
