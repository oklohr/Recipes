## Ingredients
8 slices whole wheat bread
1 cup tomato sauce
8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced

### FOR THE CHICKEN PARMESAN
1 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup Italian style breadcrumbs
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut crosswise in half
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 large eggs, beaten

## Process
Preheat a waffle iron to medium-high heat. Lightly oil the top and bottom of the waffle iron or coat with nonstick spray.

Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.

In a large bowl, combine breadcrumbs and Parmesan; set aside.

Working one at a time, dredge chicken in flour, dip into eggs, then dredge in breadcrumbs mixture, pressing to coat.

Add chicken to the skillet and cook until evenly golden and crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

Working in batches, place bread slices into the waffle iron. Top with chicken, tomato sauce, mozzarella and remaining bread slices. Close gently and cook until golden brown and crisp, about 3-4 minutes.

Serve immediately.
