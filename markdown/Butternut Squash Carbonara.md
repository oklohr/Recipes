## Ingredients
12 ounces spaghetti
4 ounces diced pancetta
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/3 cup fresh sage leaves
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 shallot, minced
1 cup butternut squash puree
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan
1 large egg, lightly beaten
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Process
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions; reserve 1 cup water and drain well.

Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add pancetta and cook until brown and crispy, about 4-6 minutes; set aside. Reserve excess fat in the skillet.

Heat olive oil with reserved excess fat. Add sage and cook until crisped, about 3-5 seconds; set aside.

Add garlic and shallot, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Stir in butternut squash puree and 1/2 cup reserved pasta water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 3-5 minutes. Reduce heat to low.

Working quickly, stir in pasta, Parmesan and egg, and gently toss to combine; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add additional reserved pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached.

Serve immediately, topped with pancetta and sage.
