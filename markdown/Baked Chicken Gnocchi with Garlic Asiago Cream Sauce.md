## Ingredients
6 thighs, bone-in, skin-on chicken
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
2 cups baby spinach, roughly chopped
17.6 oz (500g) gnocchi
Chopped fresh parsley leaves

### For The Garlic Asiago Cream Sauce
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup (240ml) chicken broth, or more, as needed
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1/2 cup (125ml) half and half
1/2 cup freshly grated Asiago cheese
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Process
Preheat your oven to 400°F(200°C) and oil a rimmed baking dish. Season chicken thighs with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.

Cook gnocchi according to package directions. Drain in a colander and set aside.

In the meantime, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Sear chicken on both sides, starting skin-side down, until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side; drain and set aside.

Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the same skillet. Stir in chopped spinach and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to wilt, about 2 minutes. Set spinach aside.

To make the garlic asiago cream sauce, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add minced garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Gradually whisk in chicken broth and Italian seasoning. Cook, whisking constantly, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in half and half and grated Asiago cheese until slightly thickened. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste.

Arrange chicken thighs into the prepared baking dish. Top with cooked gnocchi, spinach and Asiago cream sauce. Roast in the oven until completely cooked through, about 25-30 minutes. Serve hot, garnished with parsley. Enjoy!
