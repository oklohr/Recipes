## Ingredients
### SQUASH
1 winter squash, halved + cut into 2 inch wedges
2 tablespoons olive oil
kosher salt + pepper
3/4 cup pomegranate juice
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
arils from 1 pomegranate

### CARBONARA
1 pound De Cecco Spaghetti
4 slices bacon diced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound Brussels sprouts shaved
2 cloves garlic minced or grated
3 eggs
1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese plus more for serving
pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
Â½ cup fresh parsley chopped

## Process
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

To make the squash. On a rimmed baking sheet, toss together the squash, olive oil, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven and roast for 20 minutes, then flip and roast another 20 minutes or until the squash is tender and lightly charred.

Combine the pomegranate juice, honey and crushed red pepper flakes in a small saucepan set over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and simmer for 8-10 minutes or until the mixture reduces into a thin syrup. Stir in half the pomegranate arils. Toss the roasted squash in the syrup to coat.

Meanwhile, make the De Cecco Spaghetti. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water and then, drain.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the bacon. Cook until the fat renders and bacon is crisp, about 2-3 minutes. Add the olive oil and Brussels sprouts and cook, stirring occasionally, until sprouts are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute or until fragrant. Add the drained pasta and give it a good toss. Cook for about 2 minutes, until warmed through.

Beat together the eggs and Parmesan in a medium bowl. Remove the pasta from the heat and pour over the egg/cheese mixture, tossing quickly to ensure the eggs do not scramble. Continue tossing until the sauce thickens. Thin out the sauce with just a little bit of the reserved pasta water, adding slowly, until it reaches your desired consistency. Add the roasted squash.

Season the carbonara with plenty of freshly ground black pepper, salt, and garnish with pomegranate arils.
