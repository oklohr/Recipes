## Process
### Chocolate Cookie Crust
Place the cookie crumbs, butter, and salt in a mixing bowl.  Toss to combine and until the cookies are evenly moistened.  Tip the mixture into an 8 or 9-inch pie tin (or tart pan, with a removable bottom) and press evenly into the sides and bottom of the pan. 

 Use the bottom of a drinking glass or flat measuring cup to make sure the bottom is flat and the sides/corners are packed in tight.  Set aside.

### Peanut Butter Pie Filling
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a bowl with a hand mixer), mix together the cream cheese and peanut butter on medium speed until smooth.  Add in 2 tablespoons of heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla.  Mix until combined.

In a clean bowl, whisk the heavy cream on medium-high speed until medium peaks form.  Fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture until combined.  

Spoon the peanut butter pie filling into the chocolate cookie crust.  Spread the top of the filling with the back of a spoon or offset spatula until smooth.  Place the pie in the refrigerator as you prepare the whipped cream.
