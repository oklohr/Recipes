## Ingredients
1 (14.4-ounce) package graham crackers
1 cup unsalted butter, cubed
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup pecans, chopped

## Process
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.

Spread graham crackers in an even layer onto the prepared baking sheet, covering the entire sheet.

In a medium saucepan, combine butter, sugar vanilla and salt over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until butter has melted and mixture is almond brown in color, about 10-15 minutes.

Immediately spread the hot caramel mixture evenly over the graham crackers. Sprinkle with chocolate chips. After 1-2 minutes, spread the chocolate chips in an even layer until smooth. Sprinkle with pecans.

Let cool completely, about 2 hours. Break into pieces.
