[Creamed Corn Pasta with Fried Herbs. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/creamed-corn-pasta-with-fried-herbs/#bo-recipe)

## Ingredients
1 pound pasta
4 tablespoons butter
3 ears sweet corn, kernels removed from the cob
kosher salt and pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
2 cloves garlic, minced or grated
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes
1/3-2/3 cup whole milk or heavy cream
3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling
1/4 cup fresh basil leaves
4 sprigs fresh thyme

## Process
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package directions until al dente. Just before draining, remove 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta.

Add the butter to a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the corn and season with salt and pepper. Cook 5-8 minutes or until the corn has browned lightly and caramelized. Stir in the chopped thyme, garlic, and crushed red pepper flakes, and cook 1 minute more. Add the milk and simmer until warmed. 

Add the pasta, parmesan, and splash of the pasta cooking water and toss to combine. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the pasta is warmed throughout. If needed, thin the sauce with more cream or water. Remove from the heat and stir in a handful of basil. Season with salt and pepper. 

Add a drizzle of olive oil to a small skillet set over medium high heat. When the oil sizzles, add the basil leaves and thyme sprigs and fry 30 seconds or until crisp. Remove the skillet from the heat.

Divide the pasta among plates and top with fried herbs. Eat!
