## Ingredients
225g dark chocolate, 70% cocoa solids
175g unsalted butter, chopped, diced
2 tsp vanilla extract
¼ tsp instant coffee powder or extract
100g toasted almonds
2 heaped tbsp plain flour
½ tsp salt
5 eggs
140g golden caster sugar
12 fresh or defrosted frozen raspberries, plus about 40 more for decoration
4 tbsp raspberry jam

### For the glaze
140g dark chocolate, 70% cocoa solids, chopped
100ml double cream
icing sugar and sweet vanilla cream, to serve

## Process
Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Line the bases of two 23cm cake tins with baking parchment. Melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave; leave to cool. Stir in the vanilla and coffee powder.

Whizz the almonds in a food processor until finely ground, then add flour and salt, and transfer to a bowl. Whisk the eggs with an electric mixer for 5 mins, until doubled in volume. Slowly add the sugar, whisk for 1 min more. Fold in the cooled chocolate mixture until just combined. Sprinkle over half the flour mixture and fold in, then the other half. The mixture will be rather runny.

Divide between the two tins and bake for about 15 mins until a skewer comes out with a few crumbs attached – the sponges should be slightly undercooked. Cool in tin, then turn out onto a wire rack.

Choose the less perfect of the two, then set it on a serving plate. Mash 12 raspberries and stir in the jam. Spread on the base, then top with the other cake.

For the glaze, bring the cream to the boil, pour it over the chocolate and whisk until smooth. Leave for a few mins until starting to thicken, then spread over the top and sides to cover. Decorate with raspberries. Chill for up to 24 hrs. Remove from fridge 1 hr before serving, dust with icing sugar, and serve with vanilla cream.
