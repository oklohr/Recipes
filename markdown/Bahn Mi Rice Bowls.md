[Bahn Mi Rice Bowls](http://www.skinnytaste.com/slow-cooker-banh-mi-rice-bowls/)

## Ingredients
1 pound pork tenderloin
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
3 cloves crushed garlic
1 jalapeno, sliced
1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce*
1 tablespoon brown sugar
### Picked Carrot:
6 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup shredded carrots
2 radishes, cut into matchsticks
### Bowls
3 cups cooked brown rice
1 cup shredded red cabbage
1 cup thinly sliced English cucumbers (about Â½ small)
1 small jalapeno, thinly sliced
1/4 cup cilantro leaves

## Process
Season the pork with salt and pepper and place into the slow cooker. Combine the garlic, jalapeno, soy sauce and brown sugar and stir to dissolve, pour over the pork.(NOTE: If your slow cooker runs hot, add 1/4 cup water). Cover and cook on low for 6 hours until the pork is very tender, turning once half way through if desired. When the pork is ready, shred the meat. Reserve the sauce.

Meanwhile, while the pork is cooking, make the pickled carrots and radish: In a medium glass bowl, combine the vinegar, sugar and salt and stir until dissolved. Add the carrots and radish and let it sit for about 30 minutes. Drain well and refrigerate until ready to use.

To assemble the bowls, place 3/4 cup rice in each bowl, top each with about 2 1/2 oz pork, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the reserved sauce then top with the 1/4 cup shredded cabbage, 1/4 cup pickled carrots, 1/4 cup cucumber, sliced jalapenos and cilantro.
