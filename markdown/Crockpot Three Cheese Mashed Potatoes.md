[Crockpot Three Cheese Mashed Potatoes. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/crockpot-three-cheese-mashed-potatoes/)

## Ingredients
5 pounds russets or yukon gold potatoes peel (if you like) and cube
4 cloves garlic peeled and smashed
1 cup low sodium chicken broth or water
2 cups whole milk
1 teaspoon salt and pepper plus more to taste
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded gruyere cheese
1/2 cup grated parmesan
6 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon sage

## Process
Add the potatoes, garlic, chicken broth, salt and pepper to the crockpot. Cover and cook on high for 4-5 hours hours or on low for 6-8 hours. When the potatoes are fork tender, add 1 1/2 cups milks and mash them using a potato masher or a hand held mixer until completely creamy, adding the remaining 1/2 cup milk if needed to thin. Stir in the cheese, cover and cook another 15 minutes or until melted and creamy.

Meanwhile, in a skillet melt the butter over medium heat until just browned, whisking the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan. Stir in the sage and let cook 30 seconds. Pour the browned butter into the warm mashed potatoes. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired. SERVE!
