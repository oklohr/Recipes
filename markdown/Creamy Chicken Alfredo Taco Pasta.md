## Ingredients
1 pound small pasta
1 stick salted butter
4 ounces cream cheese donâ€™t use low-fat
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 cup fresh grated Parmesan Cheese
1 teaspoon Ranch Dressing Seasoning Mix
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 cup finely chopped white onion
3 cups shredded cooked chicken (I used a rotisserie chicken)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 cup fresh chopped cilantro
1 cup quartered cherry tomatoes for garnish
2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro for garnish

## Process
Cook pasta according to package directions. I generally cook one minute less than package says so that my pasta stays al dente. Drain and set aside for a moment.

To prepare homemade alfredo sauce, place butter, cream cheese and heavy whipping cream into a large skillet or saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir and whisk until melted and combined. Whisk in Parmesan cheese, Ranch seasoning and black pepper. Reduce heat to low and stir until creamy and thickened.

Place olive oil into a large skillet over medium heat. When hot, saute onion for 5 minutes or until softened. Add chicken, stirring until hot. Transfer cooked pasta, onions and chicken to alfredo sauce, stirring to combine. Stir in ground cumin and cilantro. Garnish with cherry tomatoes and more chopped cilantro.
