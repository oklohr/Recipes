## Ingredients
 1 tablespoon olive oil
 ½ yellow onion, chopped
 3 cloves garlic, minced
 30 oz pinto beans, rinsed and drained
 ½ cup vegetable broth
 ½ teaspoon ground cumin
 ½ teaspoon chili powder
 ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
 Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste
 Fresh lime juice and cilantro, optional

## Process
In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add the garlic and sauté for 2 more minutes.

Add the pinto beans, vegetable broth, cumin, chili powder, and oregano. Stir and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.

Remove the pan from the heat. Use an immersion blender, potato masher, or a wooden spoon to mash the beans to your desired consistency. You can also transfer the bean mixture to a food processor and blend if you like really smooth refried beans.

Season with salt and pepper, to taste. You can also add in a little fresh lime juice and fresh cilantro, if desired. Serve the refried beans warm!
