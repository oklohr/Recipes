[HOMEMADE CINNAMON ROLL CAKE (+Video) | The Country Cook](https://www.thecountrycook.net/cinnamon-roll-cake/#wprm-recipe-container-20457)

## Ingredients
### FOR THE CAKE:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white granulated sugar
4 tsp baking powder
2 large eggs
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup salted butter (1 stick) melted

### FOR THE CINNAMON FILLING:
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) salted butter softened to room temp
1 cup packed light brown sugar
2 tbsp flour
1 tbsp ground cinnamon

### FOR THE GLAZE:
2 cups powdered sugar
5 tbsp milk
1 tsp vanilla extract

## Process
### FOR THE CAKE:
Preheat oven to 350F degrees.

Spray 9 x 13 baking dish with nonstick cooking spray (I like the kind that has flour in it).

In a large bowl (or the bowl of your stand mixer), combine ingredients for cake (except melted butter). Don't overmix, just stir until combined.

While your mixer is running, slowly add the 1/2 cup melted butter. Mix just until combined (overmixing flour in baked goods can make it tough and rubbery.) Spread this batter evenly into your baking dish.

### FOR THE FILLING:
In a small bowl, combine all your filling ingredients: softened butter, brown sugar, flour and cinnamon. Stir until combined well.

Drop the cinnamon filling by spoonfuls onto the cake batter. Take a butter knife and make swirly, marble-effect patterns all around the cake. Drag the knife through both the cinnamon and cake batter.

Bake the cake for about 35-40 minutes (it took about 40 minutes in my oven), until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.

### FOR THE GLAZE:
Whisk together powdered sugar, milk and vanilla extract in small bowl. Pour the glaze over the warm cake.
