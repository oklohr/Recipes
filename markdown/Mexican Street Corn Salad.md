## Ingredients
6 large ears of corn, shucked
1/2 cup cilantro, finely chopped
1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled
1/2 large lemon or 1 lime, juice of
1/4 cup plain yogurt, 2+% fat
3 tbsp mayo (I used avocado)
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
Ground black pepper, to taste

## Process
Cook corn by boiling it for 15 minutes or by grilling on medium heat for 20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes. Or even better – make Instant Pot corn in 2 minutes! Let cool until safe to handle.

Using sharp chef’s knife remove corn kernels off the cob by cutting lengthwise. And Ukrainian in me cleaned up those ears pretty clean afterwards – so much food would have been wasted.

In a large salad bowl, add corn, cilantro, feta cheese, lemon or lime juice, yogurt, mayo, salt, cayenne and black pepper to taste.

Stir gently and serve warm or cold. Welcome to the streets of Mexico!
