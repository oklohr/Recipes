Start by spraying a  6 or 7 quart slow cooker with cooking spray. Add in water, beer, Old Bay Seasoning, and garlic.  Stir until well combined.

Place potatoes, onion  and celery in slow cooker and squeeze lemons over mixture in slow cooker.

Place lemon halves to slow cooker.

Cover the crockpot and  cook on Low heat setting 4-5 hours.

Add sausage and corn, cover and cook 2 hours longer.

Increase heat setting to HIGH and add  in your shrimp. Your crockpot will be very full, so do your best to stir a little and squeeze your shrimp in. Cover and cook 30-40 minutes or until shrimp are pink.

Drain your Crockpot Low Country Boil using a large strainer. Serve this meal on a newspaper covered table for easy clean up. We enjoyed ours with cocktail sauce, fresh lemon and some Cajun seasoning.
