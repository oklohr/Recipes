## Ingredients
**CHOCOLATE DOUGH:**
1 cup butter, softened
1-1/2 cups sugar
2 large eggs, room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup baking cocoa
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup coarsely chopped pecans
5 ounces white baking chocolate, chopped

**VANILLA DOUGH:**
1 cup butter, softened
1-1/2 cups sugar
2 large eggs, room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup coarsely chopped pecans
4 ounces German sweet chocolate, chopped

## Process
For chocolate dough, in a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Stir in pecans and white chocolate.

For vanilla dough, in another large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Combine the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Stir in pecans and German chocolate. Cover and refrigerate both doughs for 2 hours.

Divide both doughs in half. Shape each portion into a 12-in. roll; cover. Refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours.

Uncover and cut each roll in half lengthwise. Place a chocolate half and vanilla half together, pressing to form a log; repeat with remaining dough. Cover and refrigerate until the dough holds together when cut, about 1 hour.

Using a serrated knife, cut into 1/4-in. slices. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets . Bake at 350Â° until set, 8-10 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool.
