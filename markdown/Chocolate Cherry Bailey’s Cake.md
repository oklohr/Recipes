## Ingredients
### For the cake
2 cups flour
2 cups sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup whole milk
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons Cherry Bailey’s
1/2 cup boiling water

### For the ganache
300 grams dark chocolate
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup whipping cream

### For the butter cream
1/2 cup butter (softened)
2 cups icing sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla
2 tablespoons whipping cream

### To garnish
3 1/2 cups mixed fruit ( I used a combination of raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, cherries, and fresh figs)

## Process
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.

In the base of a stand-mixer fitted with a beater attachment, combine your flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cocoa powder, and turn the machine on low to combine. Add your eggs, milk, vanilla extract, Cherry Baileys, and turn your mixer on medium speed to get everything combined. Turn your mixer up to high, very carefully add your boiling water, and beat for 1 minute.

Divide the batter between 2 greased 9 inch cake pans, and bake for 30 – 35 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then carefully transfer your cakes onto a rack, and cool for another 35-40 minutes.

While the cakes are cooling, get your buttercream and chocolate rocking.

In a stand-mixer, beat your butter until creamy (about 1 minute). Add your icing sugar and beat on low. Then add your vanilla and cream, turn up the mixer to medium, and beat until smooth. Set aside.

Fit a large, heat proof bowl over a saucepan filled with 1 inch of simmering water. Be sure the water is not touching the bowl. Add your chocolate, butter, and cream, and melt together. Stir until smooth, and set aside.

Place one cake on top of your cake stand (or plate). Spread the butter cream on top, getting it totally covered. Add about 1 cup of fresh fruit on top, and push down slightly into the butter cream. *if you use strawberries, half them. If you use cherries, make sure to remove the pits.

Place your second cake tier on top, and spread your chocolate ganache all over the top layer. Top with the rest of your fresh fruit.
