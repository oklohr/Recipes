[Cookie Jar Gingersnaps Recipe | Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/cookie-jar-gingersnaps/)

## Ingredients
3/4 cup shortening
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, divided
1 large egg, room temperature
1/4 cup molasses
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1-1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt

## Process
Preheat oven to 350°. Cream shortening and 1 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and molasses. In another bowl, combine next five ingredients; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well.

Shape level tablespoonfuls of dough into balls. Dip one side into remaining sugar; place 2 in. apart, sugary side up, on greased baking sheets. Bake until lightly browned and crinkly, 12-15 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool.

### Notes
Because shortening melts at a higher temperature than butter, it’s useful for baking cookies that you want to have a nice uniform shape.

For easy cleanup, spritz the measuring cup with a little cooking spray before measuring sticky ingredients like honey and molasses.
