 [Honey Strawberry Peach Pie](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/honey-strawberry-peach-pie/) 

## Ingredients
### CRUST
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour plus more for rolling
3/4 cup finely ground toasted pecans (see notes) (or more flour)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter cut into pieces
1 large egg yolk
1/3 cup cold buttermilk plus more if needed

### FILLING
5 cups fresh sliced peaches about 5 peaches
2 cups fresh strawberries hulled + halved
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon bourbon optional
2 tablespoons butter sliced thinly
1 egg beaten
coarse sugar for sprinkling

## Process
### CRUST
Place the all-purpose flour, finely ground pecans and salt in a large bowl. Add butter and use your fingers to break the butter into the flour until mixture resembles small peas. Whisk the egg yolk with 1/4 cup cold buttermilk in a small bowl and then add the egg mixture to the flour mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon, drizzle in more buttermilk as needed (no more than 1 tablespoon at a time), until dough just comes together (a few dry spots are ok). Gently knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until no dry spots remain, about 1 minute. Divide the dough in half. Shape each piece into a circular disk. At this point you can cover the dough and place it in the fridge for up to one week OR continue on with the recipe...yes, no chilling needed!

### TO MAKE THE PIE
Grease an 8 or 9-inch pie plate.

In a large bowl toss together the peaches, strawberries, brown sugar, honey, flour, vanilla extract and bourbon. Toss well to coat, making sure everything is well mixed. Spoon the filling into the prepared pie plate. Make sure to scrape in all the good juices left in the bowl! Add the pats of butter over top of the fruit.

Grab the reserved pie round and cut into 1 inch thick strips. Weave the strips back and forth to create a lattice top: gently thread the strips over and under each other, pulling the strips back and forth as necessary to create the lattice. Here is a great [how-to video]( http://www.marthastewart.com/354825/rhubarb-strawberry-lattice-pie).

Push the edges of the top crust into the pie plate and then crimp the edges of the bottom crust together with the top crust. You can crimp fancy or crimp simple. Brush the top crust with the beaten egg and sprinkle the pie with course sugar.

Cover and chill pie until crust is firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place pie on a baking sheet and bake until juices are bubbling and crust is deep golden brown, about 1 hour. If the crust is getting too brown, tent with foil. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool before cutting. Serve with a scoop...or two of ice cream!

### RECIPE NOTES
To toast the pecans, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread 1-2 cups of whole pecans on a baking sheet in and even layer. Place in the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking until toasted. Allow the nuts to cool completely and pulse in a food processor until finely ground. Use 3/4 cups of ground pecans for this recipe.

Alternately if you prefer to not make a lattice, you can simply lay the pie round over the filling, then, using a sharp knife, slice four holes in the top of the crust for air pockets. Proceed as directed above.
