[Freezer Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Breakfast Sandwiches - Damn Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2019/03/09/freezer-sausage-egg-and-cheese-breakfast-sandwiches/)

## Ingredients
12 eggs, lightly beaten
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 pound ground pork
1 teaspoon crushed fennel seeds
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
Pinch of ground cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons canola oil
6 English muffins, split and lightly toasted
6 slices yellow American cheese

## Process
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9 x 13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.

Season eggs with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add eggs to the prepared baking dish. Place into oven and bake util eggs are just set, about 13-15 minutes; let cool 5 minutes. Cut out 6 rounds using a 3 1/2-inch biscuit cutter.

In a large bowl, combine ground pork, fennel seeds, thyme, garlic powder, oregano, cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.

Divide the pork mixture into sixths and shape each portion into 3 1/2-inch patties.

Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add patties to the skillet and cook until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side; let cool 5 minutes.

Place one sausage patty over the muffin bottom. Top with 1 slice cheese and 1 egg round, and then cover with another muffin top to create a sandwich. Repeat with remaining English muffins to make 6 sandwiches. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and place in the freezer.

To reheat, remove plastic wrap from the frozen sandwich and wrap in a paper towel. Place into microwave for 1-2 minutes, or until heated through completely.
