[Crazy Tender Slow Cooker French Dip Sandwiches](http://www.carlsbadcravings.com/best-slow-cooker-french-dip-sandwiches/)

## Ingredients
1 - 3-4 lb. chuck roast excess fat removed
2 packets Lipton Beefy Onion Soup mix only use 1 packet if using beef stock
4 cups water or 1 quart of beef stock
1 package sliced mushrooms
1 onion sliced thin
1 stick butter
6-8 french rolls sliced
6-8 slices Swiss or Provolone cheese

## Process
Remove any excess fat from the roast, and place into your crock pot.

Sprinkle the packets of soup mix over the roast into the crock pot.

Pour the water over the roast, making sure the roast is completely covered.
Cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 5-6 hours.

When tender remove the roast from the crockpot and shred it with a fork.
Strain the remaining juice to be used for dipping.

Butter and toast the inside of the rolls, cut side down in a big pan.

Quickly warm up the slices of cheese in the pan right before adding it to the sandwich.

Layer the shredded beef and the warmed sliced cheese into the toasted roll. Serve with a ramekin of warm au jus to dip.

## Recipe Notes
*The beef can be more or less than 3 pounds, but 3 pounds is roughly the amount for 6 sandwiches.
**Beef consomme can usually be found in the canned section next to the beef broth OR the soups.  If you can't find it make sure to ask someone.  If your store doesn't carry it, you may substitute beef broth.
