## Ingredients
### CHOCOLATE FUGE FILLING
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2/3 cup whole milk or heavy cream
1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons salted butter, cubed
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

### DOUGH
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
2 sticks (1 cup) cold salted butter, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1 egg, beaten, for brushing

### FROSTING
2 cups powdered sugar
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 ounces dark or milk chocolate, melted
coarse salt or sugar, for sprinkling

## Process
To make the chocolate fudge filling. In a small saucepan, stir together the cocoa powder, milk, and 3/4 cup chocolate chips. Set over medium heat and cook, stirring, for 5-8 minutes, until the chocolate is melted and the sauce has thickened slightly. Remove from heat, stir in the remaining 3/4 cup chocolate chips, the butter, and vanilla until smooth. Transfer to the fridge to cool and thicken, at least 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the dough. In a food processor, combine the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and butter. Pulse until the mix clumps together to forms pea-size balls. Add 1/2 cup cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough comes together and forms a ball. If the dough feels dry, add 1-2 tablespoons additional water.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Roll out into a 1/8-inch thickness. Cut the dough into rectangles, about 4 x 3 inches. Place a tablespoon of the chilled chocolate fudge on one half of the rectangles, leaving a 1/4 inch border. Brush the edges with the beaten egg. Lay the other half of the dough over the filling and seal the edges by crimping with the back of a fork. Repeat until you've used all the dough, you will have leftover fudge.

Place the pop tarts on parchment-lined baking sheets. Cover the baking sheets and place in the fridge for 1 hour or the freezer for 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake the pop tarts for 15-20 minutes. The pop tarts will still leak a little. Cool completely before frosting.

Meanwhile, make the frosting. In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, and 3 tablespoons water until smooth. Stir in the melted chocolate. If your frosting is too thick, thin with 1-2 tablespoons additional water.

Spoon a thin layer of the frosting on top of the cooled pop-tarts. Allow frosting to harden 10 minutes. Sprinkle with coarse sugar or salt. Place on a baking sheet and allow the pop tarts to harden, uncovered, about 2 hours. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

### RECIPE NOTES
Crimping and Sealing the Pop Tarts: It's import to really seal the tarts well or your filling will leak out while baking. Using the beaten egg helps to seal the fudge inside. 

For a Shinny, Glossy Frosting: Use 2 tablespoons meringue powder. In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer, whisk together the powdered sugar, meringue powder, cocoa powder, vanilla, and 3 tablespoons water for 7-10 minutes on medium speed, until smooth soft peaks form. Stir in the melted chocolate. If your frosting seems too thick, thin with 1-2 tablespoons additional water.

If you don't have a Food Processor: You can use use you fingers to mix the butter with the flour until the butter is pea sized. Slowly drizzle in the cold water as directed.
