## Ingredients
**For Thai Meatballs:**
2 lbs ground turkey
1 cup zucchini, shredded & liquid squeezed out
1 tbsp fish sauce
1/4 cup green onions, finely chopped
2 tbsp basil, finely chopped
2 tsp ginger, grated
2 garlic cloves, grated
1 tsp red curry paste
2 tbsp coconut milk, light (canned)
1/8 tsp red pepper flakes
Cooking spray (I use Misto)

**For Thai Meatballs Sauce:**
1 + 1/2 cup coconut milk, light (canned)
3 tbsp tomato paste
1 tsp red curry paste
1 tsp fish sauce
1/8 tsp red pepper flakes, more to taste
5â€“6 dried kaffir lime leaves (optional)**

## Process
In a medium bowl, combine Thai Meatballs ingredients and mix with your hands thoroughly. Make 28 meatballs by spooning heaping 1 tbsp of mixture and rolling between your hands. Lay on a cutting board or plate. Set aside.

In a small bowl, whisk together Thai Meatballs Sauce ingredients and set aside.
Preheat large ceramic non-stick skillet on medium-high heat and spray with cooking spray. Add meatballs and cook until brown or for 2-3 minutes, turning a few times. No need to cook the meatballs through.

Add the sauce, reduce heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes, uncovered. Serve warm with brown rice or brown rice noodles. Add garnish like fresh cilantro and green onions.
