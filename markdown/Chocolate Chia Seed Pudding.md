## Ingredients
1/4 cup cacao powder or unsweetened cocoa powder
3-5 Tbsp maple syrup
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon(*optional*)
1 pinch sea salt
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups almond milk
1/2cup chia seeds

## Process
To a small mixing bowl add cacao powder (sift first to reduce clumps), maple syrup, ground cinnamon, salt, and vanilla and whisk to combine. Then add a little dairy-free milk at a time and whisk until a paste forms. Then add remaining dairy-free milk and whisk until smooth.

Add chia seeds and whisk once more to combine. Then cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 3-5 hours (until itâ€™s achieved a pudding-like consistency).

Leftovers keep covered in the fridge for 4-5 days, though best when fresh.Serve chilled with desired toppings, such as fruit, granola, or coconut whipped cream.
