[Glazed Lemon Poppy Seed Bars Recipe | Practically Homemade](https://practicallyhomemade.com/glazed-lemon-poppy-seed-bars/)

## Ingredients
1/2 cup butter {softened}
3/4 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 tbsp lemon juice
1/4 tsp salt
zest from 1/2 lemon
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 tbsp poppy seeds

### Glaze
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 tbsp lemon juice
zest from 1/2 lemon

## Process
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare an 8x8 square pan by spraying it with non-stick spray.  In a large bowl combine butter, sugar, eggs, lemon juice, salt and zest.  You can mix it by hand but I used a hand mixer.  Add flour and mix until just combined.  Then add poppy seeds and stir in by hand.  Pour into prepared pan and spread into an even layer.  Bake for 18-22 minutes or until edges are brown the middle is set.  Do not over bake, you want the texture to be like that of a brownie.  Let it cool.

While the lemon poppy seed bars are cooling, combine the glaze ingredients and whisk them together.  Pour it over the cooled bars and spread out into an even layer over the top.  Cut into squares and serve.  Store at room temperature or in the refrigerator in an air tight container.
