[Chicken Katsu Sandwiches Recipe | Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spicy-chicken-katsu-sandwiches)

## Ingredients
½ cup mayonnaise
¼ cup chopped bread-and-butter pickles
2 Tbsp. plus ¼ cup hot sauce, such as Crystal
1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more
½ cup all-purpose flour
3 Tbsp. cayenne pepper
2 tsp. garlic powder
1 large egg
2 cups panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, lightly pounded to ½" thick
¼ cup (or more) extra-virgin olive oil
8 slices [milk bread](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/japanese-milk-bread)
Shredded iceberg lettuce (for serving)

## Process
Combine mayonnaise, pickles, and 2 Tbsp. hot sauce in a small bowl. Season with salt; set aside.

Combine flour, cayenne, garlic powder, and remaining 1 tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Whisk egg and remaining ¼ cup hot sauce in another medium bowl. Place panko on a large plate. Working one at a time, dip chicken into flour dredge, turning to coat. Shake off any excess. Dip into egg mixture until coated, shaking off excess. Dredge in panko, turning to coat. Transfer to a large plate or a small rimmed baking sheet.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Working in 2 batches, cook chicken, reducing heat to medium if it’s browning too quickly, until golden and very crisp on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack.

Spread reserved spicy mayo on one side of each slice of bread. Top with chicken and shredded lettuce, then close up sandwiches.
