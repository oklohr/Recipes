[Spaghetti with No-Cook Puttanesca](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spaghetti-with-no-cook-puttanesca)

## Ingredients
2 beefsteak tomatoes (about 1 lb.), halved crosswise, seeds removed
2 garlic cloves, finely grated
1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
2 tsp. kosher salt, plus more
1½ cups cherry tomatoes, halved
1 cup Castelvetrano olives, crushed, pits removed
2 Tbsp. drained capers
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
12 oz. spaghetti
¼ cup finely chopped parsley
3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces

## Process
Pulse beefsteak tomatoes, garlic, red pepper flakes, and 2 tsp. salt in a food processor until smooth; transfer sauce to a large bowl and mix in cherry tomatoes, olives, capers, and ¼ cup oil.

Cook spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain pasta, reserving ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid.

Add pasta, parsley, and butter to sauce. Toss vigorously with tongs, adding a splash of pasta cooking liquid or more as needed to create an emulsified sauce that coats pasta. Divide among bowls and drizzle with more oil.
