[Peach Burrata Pizza with Honey Balsamic. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/peach-burrata-pizza-honey-balsamic/)

## Ingredients
1/2 pound homemade or store-bought pizza dough
3-5 tablespoons basil pesto
4 ounces blue cheese crumbled
3-4 ripe peaches thinly sliced
1 cup fresh basil leaves torn
8 ounces burrata cheese
olive oil for drizzling
sea salt + pepper to taste
handful of Italian microgreens

### HONEY BALSAMIC
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup honey
pinch of crushed red pepper flakes

## Process
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a large baking sheet with olive oil.

On a lightly floured surface, push/roll the dough out until until it is pretty thin (about a 10-12 inch circle). Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Spread the dough with pesto and top with blue cheese. Add the sliced peaches and about half of the basil. Drizzle the pizza lightly with olive oil, salt and pepper.

Place in the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden, the cheese has melted and the peaches have caramelized. Remove from the oven and top with salami and burrata. Allow the burrata to sit on the pizza and warm through, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle on the remaining basil, and drizzle the pizza with the honey balsamic (see below). if desired add a handful of microgreens. Slice and eat!

### HONEY BALSAMIC
Combine all ingredients together in a bowl and whisk until smooth. Serve, drizzled over the pizza.
