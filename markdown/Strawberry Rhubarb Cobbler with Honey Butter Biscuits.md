## Ingredients
3 cups fresh or frozen strawberries halved or quartered
2 cups diced rhubarb about 2 stalks
1/2 cup coconut sugar may sub brown sugar or granulated sugar
zest of 1 lemon
2 teaspoons vanilla
teaspoon pinch of sea salt about 1/4
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons salted butter melted
whipped cream for serving

### BISCUITS
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
8 tablespoons cold salted butted cubed, or unsalted with a pinch of salt
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup honey
coarse sugar for sprinkling (optional)

## Process
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly rub a 10-12 inch cast iron skillet (or large pie plate) with a little softened butter or cooking spray.

In the skillet, combine the strawberries, rhubarb, coconut sugar, lemon zest, vanilla and a pinch of sea salt. Toss well to combine.

In a large bowl, combine flour and baking powder. Whisk until combined. Using a fork, pastry blender or your hands, add butter pieces to the flour and mix until coarse little crumbles remain. Whisk together the buttermilk and honey and pour into the flour. Stir with a spoon until just combined, trying not to over mix. Use your hands if needed to bring the dough together.

Use a 1/4 cup measure to drop batter onto the cobbler or press dough out on a sheet of parchment paper or cutting board, and then use a biscuit cutter to shape the dough into rounds. Place the rounds on top of the cobbler. Sprinkle the biscuits with coarse sugar.

Bake the cobbler for 35-40 minutes or until the strawberries are bubbling and the biscuits lightly golden.

In a bowl, stir together the honey with the melted butter.

Serve the cobbler warm with whipped cream and a drizzle of the honey butter. EAT!
