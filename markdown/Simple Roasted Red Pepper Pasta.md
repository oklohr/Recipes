## Ingredients
1 (16 ounce) jar roasted red peppers or 2 roasted red peppers
1/2 cup oil packed sun-dried tomatoes oil drained + reserved
2 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 cup toasted almonds or pine nuts
1/2 cup grated parmesan omit if vegan
1 pound short or long cut pasta use gluten free if needed
1 bunch fresh basil roughly chopped
2 handfuls fresh arugula or watercress
8 ounces fresh buffalo mozzarella or burrata cheese torn
pepper + crushed red pepper to taste
fresh figs + toasted pine nuts for serving (optional)

## Process
Combine the roasted red peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, salt, nuts and parmesan in a blender or food processor. Add 1/4 cup of the oil from the sun-dried tomato jar and then pulse to combine until the sauce is mostly smooth.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil the pasta until al dente, reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and then drain. Add the pasta right back to the hot pot along with the roasted red pepper sauce and about 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta cooking water. Toss to combine. Add the basil and toss. Thin the sauce as desired with more pasta cooking water.

Divide the pasta among plates or bowls and top with fresh arugula, mozzarella, figs and nuts. EAT!
