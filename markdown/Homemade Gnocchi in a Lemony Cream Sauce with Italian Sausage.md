## Ingredients
1 DeLallo gnocchi kit
3-4 links of Italian sausage, casings removed
2 Tbs. butter
2 Tbs. all-purpose flour
3 cloves garlic, minced or grated
1 lemon, zested and juiced
2 cups milk
1 handful minced parsley, for garnish
Coarse salt

## Process
Following the DeLallo gnocchi kit instructions, you’ll combine the contents of the package with 1 & 1/2 cups warm water. Knead the dough until no longer sticky. On a floured work surface, you’ll form a small “loaf” shape, and then cut the mass into 1-inch sticks, rolling each one out to a skinny log. Then cut the logs into 1-inch pieces. You can leave the gnocchi shape just like this, which is fluffy and perfect. OR, take a fork and gently roll the gnocchi against the tines to create the little lines. You can let the gnocchi sit on a cutting board while you prep your sauce.

Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil, and gently cook the gnocchi for about three minutes until they rise to the top. Transfer straight to the sauce. But let’s make it!

In the meantime, brown the Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium heat, until no longer pink. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set aside.

Back in the skillet, melt the butter. Once foaming, add the flour and whisk until it begins to darken, just a couple of minutes. Because the skillet is so wide, it might be a little hard to whisk the flour into the butter, so I like to tilt the skillet and whisk on one side. Add the minced garlic, lemon zest and juice and whisk until a sauce starts to form. Slowly, add the milk, a half cup at a time and keeping whisking as it thickens. Season with a good pinch of salt right here, once all the milk is added.

Add the boiled gnocchi to the cream sauce and gently toss to coat. Add the sausage back to the skillet and stir to combine. Garnish with plenty of chopped parsley, along with more lemon wedges! Always with the lemon, I know.

Serve immediately!
