[Easiest Cinnamon Buttermilk Beignets. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/easiest-cinnamon-buttermilk-beignets/)

## Ingredients
1/2 cup warm water
1 packet instant yeast (2 1/2 teaspoons)
1 tablespoon honey
1 cup buttermilk, at room temperature
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
canola or vegetable oil, for frying
powdered sugar, for dusting
hot chocolate, for serving

## Process
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the water, yeast, honey, buttermilk, egg, butter, and vanilla. Add the flour, cinnamon, and salt. Knead until the dough comes together, about 1-2 minutes. If the dough feels too sticky, add an additional 1 tablespoon of flour at a time until the dough pulls away from the sides and forms a smooth ball.

Cover the bowl and let sit in a warm place for 1-2 hours, until doubled in size.

Turn the dough onto a floured work surface. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about an 1/4 inch thick. Using a knife, cut the dough into 3Ã—3 inch squares (about 25 squares). Cover with a damp kitchen towel while the oil preheats.

Place a deep, heavy bottom pot on the stove and add enough oil to fill the pot about 1 to 1 1/2 inches deep. Turn the burner to medium and preheat the oil to 350 degrees F. Fry 4-6 beignets at a time depending on the size of your pot. Use a slotted spoon to flip them over every 30 seconds. Fry for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown on both sides. Remove with the slotted spoon and place on paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining squares.

Dust each beignet generously with powdered sugar. Enjoy warm, with a side of hot cocoa
