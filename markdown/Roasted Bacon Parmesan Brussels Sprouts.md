[Roasted Bacon Parmesan Brussels Sprouts](https://dennistheprescott.com/2015/11/17/roasted-bacon-parmesan-brussels-sprouts/)

## Ingredients
2 lb brussel sprouts
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons maple syrup
3 tablespoons olive oil
6 strips of bacon
1/3 cup parmesan cheese, shaved

## Process
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.

Give your brussel sprouts a good wash & dry well with paper towel. Slice the brussel sprouts in half (the small ones you can keep whole), and place them in a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Pour over your olive oil and maple syrup, season with salt and pepper, and give the tray a shake to toss together. Roast for 25 â€“ 30 minutes, turning halfway through, until tender.

While the brussel sprouts are doing their thing, heat a pan over medium. Fry 4 strips of bacon until nice and crispy (about 8 minutes). Crumble the bacon into small pieces and set aside.

When the brussel sprouts are cooked through and tender, take them out of the oven, transfer them to a bowl, and give them a toss with the bacon and parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
