 [Corn, Feta, and Basil Sweet Potato Noodle Carbonara](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/corn-feta-basil-sweet-potato-noodle-carbonara/) 

## Ingredients
3 slices thick cut bacon or pancetta diced (optional)
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic minced or grated
3 medium sweet potatoes spiralized*
3 ears fresh corn kernels removed
3 eggs
1 tablespoon white miso paste*
juice of 1 lemon
1 handful fresh basil roughly chopped
1/2 cup crumbled feta
kosher salt + pepper
pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
toasted almonds sliced or chopped
sliced avocado for serving (optional)

## Process
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot add the bacon or pancetta (if using). Let the bacon get nice and crispy, about 2-3 minutes. Remove the bacon from the skillet and drain any grease. Return the skillet to medium heat and add the olive oil. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for about 1 minute to soften. Add the spiralized sweet potato noodles to the skillet and give it a good toss, continue cooking, stirring often until the noodles have softened, but are not mushy, about 5-8 minutes. Once the noodles are soft, stir in the corn and cook another 2-3 minutes.

Beat together the eggs, miso and a large pinch of pepper in a glass measuring cup. Remove the noodles from the heat and pour the egg mixture into the noodles, tossing quickly (to ensure the eggs do not scramble) until the eggs thicken and create a sauce. Add the lemon juice, basil and crumbled feta and gently toss to combine with the noodles.

Season the noodles with plenty of freshly ground black pepper, salt to taste and add a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. Garnish with toasted almonds, fresh basil and sliced avocado. EAT!

### RECIPE NOTES
If you do not own a spiralizer, you can simply dice the sweet potatoes into cubes. Just make sure to really toss them well when combining them with the eggs. 

If you do not have miso paste, just season the noodles with a little more salt to your taste.
