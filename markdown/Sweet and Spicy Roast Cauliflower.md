[Sweet and Spicy Roast Cauliflower](https://www.sprinklesandsprouts.com/sweet-spicy-roast-cauliflower/)

## Ingredients
1 head of cauliflower
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 tsp ground coriander
pinch red pepper flakes - optional
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp ground black pepper

### For the dressing
2 tbsp olive oil
3 garlic cloves
1/2 cup vegetable broth
1/2 cup sultanas
2 tbsp capers - see note 1
2 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley

## Process
### To roast the cauliflower
Preheat oven to 425Â°.

Cut the cauliflower into small florets.

Spread the cauliflower over two large baking dish, ensuring you have a single layer then drizzle with the olive oil.

Season the cauliflower with the ground coriander, salt pepper and red pepper flakes if using. Roast, tossing occasionally, for 25-30 minutes until cauliflower is golden and crispy.

Whilst the cauliflower is cooking start with the dressing.

### For the dressing
Peel and thinly slice the garlic and place into a small cold frypan. (see note 2)

Pour over the oil, place it over a very low heat and cook gently for 8-10 minutes until the garlic has softened but not coloured.

Heat the vegetable broth up and pour over the sultanas. Set them aside to warm and plump up.

Once the garlic has finished cooking, drain the sultanas and add them to the oil. Stir well to coat in the oil. Add in the capers.

### To serve
Transfer the cauliflower to a serving platter. Drizzle over the oil dressing and then scatter with fresh parsley.

### Notes
For this recipe I recommend the capers packed in brine. But if you are using the capers packed in salt then rinse them gently and pat dry before adding them to the oil. If you are using the brined ones then just drain and add to the recipe.

Placing the garlic into a cold pan with cold oil will allow the garlic to cook gently and infuse the oil without burning.
