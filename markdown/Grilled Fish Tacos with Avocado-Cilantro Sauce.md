## Ingredients2 pounds meaty white fish fillets I prefer mahi-mahi or halibut
1/4 cup olive oil
1 lime juiced
1 tablespoon sriracha
1 jalapeno chopped
1/4 cup cilantro leaves chopped
1 teaspoon kosher salt
8 corn-flour tortilla shells

### For the Avocado-Cilantro Sauce:
2 cloves garlic peeled
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup light sour cream
1 ripe avocado pitted and peeled
1/4 cup cilantro leaves
juice of 1/2 lime
Freshly ground pepper to taste

### For the Garnish
Avocado-Cilantro Sauce
1 cup Red cabbage shredded
1/3 cup Red onion thinly sliced
1/3 cup Radishes thinly sliced
1 Avocado pitted, peeled and sliced
1 lime sliced in wedges
1/2 cup Cilantro leaves
Sriracha or hot sauce

## Process
### Make the Grilled Fish Tacos
Whisk together the olive oil, lime juice, sriracha, jalapeno, cilantro, and salt in a large, shallow dish. Marinate the fish for 15 minutes in the refrigerator.

Preheat the grill on high heat.

Place the marinated fish flesh side down onto the grill. Lower the heat to medium-high. Cook for about 5 minutes, then gently release the fish from the grill and flip. Cook for another 5 minutes, or until the fish is flakey when the tip of a knife is inserted into the fish. Remove fish from the grill and let it rest on a plate.

### Make the Avocado-Cilantro Sauce
In the bowl of a food processor, blend the garlic and salt until finely chopped. Add the sour cream, avocado, cilantro, lime juice, and pepper. Blend until smooth. Adjust the seasoning if necessary with salt and pepper. The sauce can be prepared ahead of time and stored in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator.

### Assemble the Fish Tacos
Warm the tortillas on the grill or in a hot skillet over medium-high heat. Spread the Avocado-Cilantro Sauce on the tortillas. Slice or flake apart the fish and place several pieces on the tortilla shells. Garnish as you wish and enjoy!
