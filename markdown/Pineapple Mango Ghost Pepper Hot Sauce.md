## Ingredients
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 ghost pepper chopped
1 cup freshly cut pineapple chopped
½ cup chopped mango
2 cherry pepper chopped
1 cup water
½ cup distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon paprika
Salt to taste

## Process
Heat a large pan to medium heat and add olive oil. Add peppers and fruit. Cook about 8 minutes to soften.

Add water, vinegar, sugar, cilantro and paprika and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.

Add to a food processor and process until smooth. Pour into sterilized bottles and serve it up!

### Recipe Notes
Heat Factor: Hot. You'll get some nice heat with the ghost peppers, though the fruit does temper it a bit.

Makes about 2-2.5 cups.
