Juice of 1 orange
Juice of 1 lime
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapeno, seeded and diced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 1/2 pounds flank steak

### For The Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette
1 cup loosely packed cilantro, stems removed
1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
2 cloves garlic
Juice of 1 lime
Pinch of salt
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

### For The Burrito Bowls
1 cup farro
1 cup pico de gallo, homemade or store-bought
1 cup corn kernels, frozen, canned or roasted
1 avocado, halved, peeled, seeded and thinly sliced
1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves

## Process
### For The Carne Asada
In a medium bowl, combine cilantro, olive oil, soy sauce, orange juice, lime juice, garlic, jalapeno, cumin and 1 teaspoon pepper; set aside 1/2 cup of the mixture in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine steak and remaining cilantro mixture; marinate for at least 4 hours to overnight, turning the bag occasionally. Drain the steak from the marinade.

Preheat grill to medium high heat. Using paper towels, pat both sides of the steak dry; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Add steak to grill, and cook, flipping once, until desired doneness, about 6 minutes per side for medium rare. Let rest 5 minutes.

Thinly slice steak against the grain and serve with reserved 1/2 cup cilantro mixture.

### For The Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette
Combine cilantro, Greek yogurt, garlic, lime juice and salt in the bowl of a food processor. With the motor running, add olive oil and vinegar in a slow stream until emulsified; set aside.

### For The Burrito Bowls
Cook farro according to package instructions. Divide into bowls. Top with carne asada, pico de gallo, corn, avocado and cilantro.

Serve with cilantro lime vinaigrette and lime.
