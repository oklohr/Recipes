## Ingredients
1.5kg mussels, washed and the beards removed
1 tbsp butter
Â½ tsp chili flakes
1 large shallot, finely chopped
3 cloves of garlic, finely sliced
100g chorizo, roughly chopped
200ml Irish Cider
100ml cream
A good handful of flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
Sour dough bread slices, to serve

## Process
Clean the mussels and discard any that are open before cooking and any that stay closed after cooking.

Place a large pot over a medium heat and brown the chorizo pieces until just golden and sizzling. Add in a knob of butter, allow it to melt and sizzle before adding the shallot, garlic and chili flakes. Cook gently for 2-3 minutes until the shallot is tender.

Add in the cider, bring to a steady boil, before adding in the mussels. Cover with a lid and allow them to steam for about four minutes until they open, making sure to give the pot a good shake once or twice during the cooking time.

Remove from the heat and stir in the cream and parsley and season with sea salt and ground black pepper.

Serve with some crusty bread to mop up the liquid!
