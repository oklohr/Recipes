1 28-ounce can Crushed Tomatoes
1/2 cup Water - That Gnocchi was cooked in
1/2 cup Chopped Basil
2 tsp Thyme
1 tsp Salt
1/2 tsp Pepper
1/4 tsp Crushed Red Pepper

## Process
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a pot, with salted water, prepare gnocchi according to package directions. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Drain and set aside.

In a 10” or 12” oven proof skillet, heat over medium heat, spray with non-stick spray. Add in onion and cook until just transluscent. Add in pork sausage, breaking up into small bits. Cook until no longer pink.

Pour in crushed tomatoes and stir together. Add in chopped basil, thyme, salt and pepper, and crushed red pepper. Stir to combine. Pour reserved 1/2 cup of water from the gnocchi. Let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.

Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella. Bake for 10-15 minute or until the cheese has melted and started to bubble. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.
