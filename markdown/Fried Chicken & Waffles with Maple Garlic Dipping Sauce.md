## Ingredients
### For the chicken
4 chicken breasts
2 cups buttermilk
2 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 – 2 red chillies
2 green onions, finely sliced

### For the waffles
2 cups flour
1/2 cup sugar
3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 eggs, separated
1 1/2 cups whole milk
1 cup butter, melted

### For the dipping sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons maple syrup
1 tablespoon sriracha
2 garlic cloves, minced

## Process
Butterfly and split your chicken breasts in half, and place in a freezer bag. Cover with your buttermilk, and place in the fridge overnight.

In a bowl, combine your flour, baking powder, and sugar. In another bowl, add your egg yolks, milk, and butter, and whisk together. Add the dry to the wet ingredients, and stir together (but do not over whisk). Beat your egg whites until stiff peaks form, and fold them in to the batter.

Bake in a waffle iron according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Heat 3 inches of canola oil in a deep dutch oven to 350 degrees.

Now, make the sauce. Grate your garlic into a small bowl. Add your soy sauce, sriracha, sesame oil, and maple syrup, and stir together. Set aside.

In a bowl, combine your flour, cayenne, onion & garlic powder, and sea salt, and stir together. Working in batches, dredge your marinated chicken in the flour, and fry for 8 – 10 minutes, until nice & crispy and the juices run clear.

Sprinkle over your sesame seeds, chilies, and green onions. Serve with your waffles, and dipping sauce.
