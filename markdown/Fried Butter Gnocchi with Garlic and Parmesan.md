[Fried Butter Gnocchi with Garlic & Parmesan Recipe — Eatwell101](https://www.eatwell101.com/garlic-butter-gnocchi-parmesan-recipe)

## Ingredients
1 1/2 lb (700g) skillet gnocchi
½ teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons unsalted butter (or ghee or olive oil)
5 cloves garlic, minced
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
⅓ cup Parmesan, freshly grated
Fresh chopped basil, or parsley

## Process
To make the Fried Butter Gnocchi with Garlic & Parmesan: Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a medium or large skillet. Add garlic and red pepper flakes to the skillet and heat until fragrant. Remove garlic from the skillet and set aside to avoid burning – you will add it back later. Leave the garlic-infused butter in the pan.

Add gnocchi to the pan (don’t clean up) and cook on high, stirring frequently for about 5 minutes. Continuously spread gnocchi evenly in the pan for crisp texture on all sides. You can add one minute for a crispier texture.

Add the garlic back to the pan, sprinkle half the parmesan and give a quick stir to coat well. Remove the garlic butter parmesan gnocchi from the pan and serve with remaining grated parmesan and chopped basil or parsley. Enjoy!

### Note
Make sure to use skillet gnocchi, so you don’t have to boil them before cooking. All you have to do is cook them on the skillet for a few minutes. No more boiling water or draining.
