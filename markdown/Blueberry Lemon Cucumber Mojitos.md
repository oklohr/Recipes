## Ingredients
1.5oz Blueberry Honey Syrup (recipe to follow)
2 oz of gin
Juice from half a lemon
5 leaves fresh mint
5 slices of cucumber
Soda water

### OPTIONAL GARNISH
Sliced cucumbers
Sliced lemon
Blueberries
Sprig of mint
Edible flowers *(I used pansies)*

### BLUEBERRY HONEY SYRUP
4 cups fresh blueberries
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup honey
Juice from half a lemon

## Process
If you’re making floral ice cubes, begin by sourcing your flowers, washing them and dropping them into the ice cube trays to freeze. You really can’t mess this up — so experiment with different flower placements within each cube and have fun with it!

Start on your Blueberry Honey Simple Syrup. Add blueberries and water to a medium sauce pan over low heat. The blueberries will begin to break down quickly — help them along by pressing them with a potato masher to aid in extracting the juices. Simmer for 15 minutes.

Strain the blueberry juice into a heatproof bowl, using the potato masher press the juice through the strainer. Reserve the juice for the Blueberry Honey Syrup and discard the skins.

Add the blueberry juice and honey back to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and allow to thicken for 10 minutes.

Turn off the burner. Add the juice from half a lemon to your saucepan, stirring until incorporated. Allow your Blueberry Honey Simple Syrup to cool before using it in the Blueberry Lemon and Cucumber Gin Mojitos.

 Begin assembling your cocktail by adding lemon juice, mint and cucumber to a cocktail shaker and muddling them together with a pestle. Add Blueberry Honey Syrup and a few ice cubes. Shake vigorously until the cocktail shaker becomes cold.

Add the contents of the cocktail shaker to your glass along with your gin. Pour soda water overtop to fill your glass to the desired level.

Garnish your Blueberry Lemon and Cucumber Gin Mojito with a slice of lemon and a few blueberries on a cocktail skewer. Add a sprig of mint, or a few more edible flowers and enjoy!
