## Ingredients
1 cup pineapple juice
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
1 tablespoon Sriracha, optional
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1/2 cup cornstarch
2 large eggs, beaten
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 cups diced pineapple, canned or fresh
1 green onion, thinly sliced
1/4 teaspoon sesame seeds

## Process
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9Ã—13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.
To make the sauce, whisk together pineapple juice, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and Sriracha in a medium bowl; set aside.

In a large bowl, season chicken with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in cornstarch and gently toss to combine. Working one at a time, dip chicken into the eggs.

Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan. Add chicken and cook until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; discard excess oil.

Add chicken and pineapple to prepared baking dish. Top with pineapple juice mixture.
Place into oven and bake until the sauce has thickened, about 55 minutes, turning over every 15 minutes to evenly coat the chicken.

Serve immediately, garnished with green onion and sesame seeds, if desired.
