[Sweet and Sour Chicken](https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/healthy-sweet-sour-chicken/)

## Ingredients
3-4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to 1/2 inch thickness and chopped into 1 inch pieces
1/3 cup corn starch
2 tablespoons oil
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 white or yellow onion, chopped
### Sauce
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar (may sub white vinegar)
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion salt*
1/4 cup ketchup
1 tablespoon corn starch
2 tablespoons cold water

## Process
First prepare the sauce. Add sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic powder, onion salt, and ketchup to a medium sauce pan. Stir and bring to a boil. In a small bowl whisk together the 1 tablespoon corn starch and cold water until dissolved. Add to sauce pan and stir until thickened, then reduce to low heat.

Add chicken pieces and corn starch to a large ziplock bag. Seal and shake to coat chicken. Drizzle a large pan or skillet with oil. Add coated chicken. Saute over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Add peppers and onions. Continue to saute over medium heat until chicken is browned and cooked through.

Add sauce to chicken and peppers. Stir to coat well. Serve warm with cooked rice if desired.

## Recipe Notes
* If you don't have onion salt, use garlic salt instead of garlic powder, and use onion powder instead of garlic salt. 
* If you don't mind a slightly less-healthy version and looooove sauce, you can double the sauce recipe.
