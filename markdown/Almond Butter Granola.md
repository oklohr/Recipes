## Ingredients
3 cups old fashioned oats
1 cup raw almonds
1/3 cup shredded coconut
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/3 cup creamy almond butter
1/3 cup honey
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Process
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, combine oats, almonds, coconut, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt; set aside.

In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine almond butter, honey and butter until smooth, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla. Pour mixture over the oats mixture and stir using a rubber spatula just until moist.

Spread mixture in an even layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Place into oven and bake for 35 minutes until golden brown, stirring the mixture halfway through baking.

Let cool completely without stirring, about 45 minutes, before serving or storing in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
