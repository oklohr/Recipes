[30-Minute Sesame Chicken Rice Bowls - The Girl on Bloor](https://thegirlonbloor.com/20-minute-sesame-chicken-rice-bowls/)

## Ingredients
4 chicken beasts, cubed
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 egg
2 tbsp sesame oil
2 tsp soy sauce or tamari
1 cup snap peas
1 red pepper, chopped
2-3 cups cooked jasmine rice
3 scallions, sliced
1 red chili pepper, sliced
Extra sesame seeds for garnish

### Sesame Sauce
1/4 cup soy sauce or tamari
1/4 cup honey
2 tbsp sesame oil
4 cloves garlic
2 tbsp cornstarch
2 tbsp sesame seeds
1 tsp fresh ginger, minced
2 tsp sriracha

## Process
Cook jasmine rice according to package directions (I usually make enough servings for 4) in a rice cooker or on the stovetop. Prepare veggies and chicken.

In a large bowl, toss chicken with cornstarch and egg. Mix together well. Meanwhile, heat 2 tbsp sesame oil in a large skillet over med-high heat. Add chicken and 2 tsp soy sauce, sauteeing for 4-5 min until chicken starts to brown.

Meanwhile, mix sauce ingredients together. Pour overtop of chicken, then add red pepper and snap peas, sauteeing for another 3-4 min until veggies are tender and sauce has thickened.

Serve chicken overtop of rice and garnish with scallions, sesame seeds and red chili peppers. 

Enjoy!
