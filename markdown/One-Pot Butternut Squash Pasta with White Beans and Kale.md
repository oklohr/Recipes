## Ingredients
1 1/2 cups loosely packed fresh basil leaves (about 1 ounce), divided
1 small lemon
1/2 cup roasted pumpkin seeds (salted or unsalted is fine)
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
6 cloves garlic
1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans
12 ounces dried linguine
1 cup canned butternut squash purée (can sub sweet potato or pumpkin purée)
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4 1/2 cups water
1/2 to 1 cup full-fat plain Greek yogurt
3 cups loosely-packed baby kale (3 ounces, can sub baby spinach or a baby kale mix)
1 ounce Parmesan cheese, shaved with a Y-peeler (about 1/4 cup)

## Process
Finely chop 1/2 cup loosely packed basil leaves and finely grate the zest of 1/2 small lemon. Transfer both to a small bowl. Add 1/2 cup roasted pumpkin seeds, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, season with salt as needed (this amount will vary depending on if your roasted pepitas were salted), and stir to combine; set aside. Halve the lemon and set aside.

Thinly slice 6 garlic cloves and add to a large straight-sided skillet (we like  [this one](https://www.crateandbarrel.com/le-creuset-signature-3.5-qt.-cream-everyday-pan/s648346) ) or Dutch oven. Drain and rinse 1 can cannellini beans. Add 1/2 the beans, the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, 12 ounces linguine, 1 cup canned butternut squash purée, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.

Add 4 1/2 cups water and bring to a boil over high heat (this will take about 5 minutes). Boil the mixture, stirring and turning the pasta with tongs to prevent sticking, until the pasta is al dente and almost all the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. In the last two minutes of cooking, add 3 cups baby kale.

Remove from the heat. Stir in 1/2 cup of the plain Greek yogurt, the remaining beans, the juice from 1/2 the lemon, and the remaining 1 cup basil leaves (tear them as you add them). Toss with tongs, and taste, adding more lemon juice and salt as needed. If you prefer a creamier pasta, add the remaining 1/2 cup yogurt. Divide the pasta between 6 bowls and garnish each bowl with the pumpkin seed-basil mixture, shaved Parmesan cheese, and more black pepper.

### RECIPE NOTES
Reheating: To reheat leftovers, warm in a skillet with a splash of water, tossing until the sauce loosens up and is creamy. Season with salt, to taste, and a squeeze of lemon juice.
