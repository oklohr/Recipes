[Brown Sugar Peach Puff Pastry Pop Tarts. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/brown-sugar-peach-puff-pastry-pop-tarts/)

## Ingredients
2 ripe peaches, chopped
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed
4 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch cinnamon
1 pinch flakey sea salt

## Process
Preheat the oven 350 degrees F.

In a medium bowl, combine the peaches, brown sugar, and vanilla.

Cut each sheet into 6 rectangles. Evenly divide the peach filling among half of the rectangles. Lay the remaining 6 rectangles over the filling and seal the edges by crimping with the back of a fork. Repeat until you have 6 tarts.

Place on parchment lined baking sheets and brush the tops of the tarts with water. Transfer to the oven and bake the tarts for 15 to 20 minutes or until puffed and deep golden brown. Let cool slightly.

Meanwhile, brown the butter on the stove. Let cool 5 minutes and then add the powder sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. If needed, add 1 tablespoon water at a time to thin the glaze as desired. Drizzle the glaze over the pop tarts. Enjoy!
