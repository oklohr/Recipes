[15 Minute One Pan Creamy Sun-dried Tomato and Basil Gnocchi â€¢ Salt & Lavender](https://www.saltandlavender.com/15-minute-creamy-sun-dried-tomato-and-basil-gnocchi/)

## Ingredients
1 tablespoon butter
4 cloves garlic minced
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons julienned sun-dried tomatoes (I used the kind packed in oil)
1/2 cup dry white wine e.g. sauvignon blanc
1 cup heavy/whipping cream
1 pound uncooked potato gnocchi
1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
Generous handful fresh basil sliced thin
Salt & pepper to taste

## Process
In a skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter. 

Add the garlic to the skillet and cook for 30 seconds. 

Stir in the Dijon mustard, sun-dried tomatoes, and white wine. Cook for 2 minutes. 

Add the cream and gnocchi to the pan. Give it a good stir and cover the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes. 

Stir in the parmesan and basil. Cook for a couple more minutes. Give the gnocchi a taste and if it's not quite done cooking, give it a couple more minutes. Season with salt & pepper as needed. Serve immediately. 

### Recipe Notes
The gnocchi will cook right in the sauce. There's no need to pre-cook it. 

Makes 4 reasonably sized portions (but I'd add a side salad or garlic bread or something if you're feeding really hungry people). Easily feeds more as a side. 

If you don't want to use white wine for whatever reason, try subbing chicken broth. If you have to keep it vegetarian, veggie broth will work too (but I haven't tested it in this particular recipe). 

This dish doesn't reheat very well (the sauce tends to separate). I suggest eating it fresh.
