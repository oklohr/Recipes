 [Hawaiian BBQ Skewers with Sriracha Lime Butter](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/hawaiian-bbq-skewers-sriracha-lime-butter/) 

## Ingredients
1/2 cup of your favorite BBQ sauce
2 tablespoons pineapple juice
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro chopped
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs cut into bite size chunks
2 cups fresh pineapple chunks
1 red bell pepper chopped into bite sized chunks
1 orange bell pepper chopped into bite size chunks
1 poblano pepper chopped into bite size chunks

### SRIRACHA HONEY BUTTER
4 tablespoons salted butter softened
1-2 tablespoons sriracha
1 tablespoon honey
zest of half a lime

## Process
To make the Hawaiian BBQ sauce, whisk together the BBQ sauce, pineapple juice, lime juice and cilantro in a medium size bowl. Now add the chicken to a gallon size ziplock bag or medium bowl and toss with 1/4 cup of the BBQ mixture.

Set your grill, grill pan or skillet to medium-high heat. Thread chicken pieces, pineapple chunks and bell peppers together, alternating one after another on skewers. Brush the skewers lightly with olive oil. Grill the skewers until lightly charred and cooked through, turning them occasionally throughout cooking, about 10 to 12 minutes total. Transfer the skewers to a plate.

Brush the skewers with sriracha butter (below) and serve with extra Hawaiian BBQ sauce. EAT!

### SRIRACHA HONEY BUTTER
