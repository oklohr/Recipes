## Ingredients
3 1/2 cups flour, sifted (see tips in post)
3/4 cup whole milk
1/3 cup water
2 Tbsp sour cream
2 Tbsp unsalted butter
2 tsp oil (canola or olive oil)
1 tsp table salt
1 Tbsp active dry yeast
1 Tbsp sugar

### egg wash
1 large egg
1 tsp water
3 Tbsp everything seasoning

## Process
In a saucepan, whisk together the milk, water, sour cream, butter, oil, and salt. Heat until warm. 

Remove from heat. Add sugar and yeast, stir. Allow yeast to activate, about 3-5 minutes.

Add in sifted flour and mix until flour is well incorporated. Cover and set aside to rise at room temperature for 1 hour, until doubled in size.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly spray with baking spray. Divide the dough into 8 parts. Shape each part into a round ball. Press finger through the center of each ball to make a hole. Pull on the dough to shape into bagel shape. The hole should be about 1 ½” in diameter.

Place bagels onto the baking sheet. Brush each bagel with egg wash and tops and sides of bagel. Season generously with the everything seasoning. Allow bagels to rise for 30 minutes.

Bake at 375°F for 20-25 minutes, until tops of bagels are crispy and golden.
