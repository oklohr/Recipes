[Grilled Corn Salad with Hot Honey-Lime Dressing Recipe | Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/grilled-corn-salad-with-hot-honey-lime-dressing)

## Ingredients
3 ears of corn, husked
2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted
1½ tsp. kosher salt, plus more
Freshly ground black pepper
3 Tbsp. fresh lime juice
2 Tbsp. honey
1½ tsp. Sriracha
1 tsp. granulated garlic or garlic powder
1½ avocados, cut into ¾" pieces
1 serrano chile, thinly sliced
½ cup cilantro leaves with tender stems

## Process
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Brush ears of corn with butter; season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning occasionally, until kernels are very tender and charred in spots, 10–12 minutes. Let cool slightly, then cut kernels from cobs.

Meanwhile, whisk lime juice, honey, Sriracha, granulated garlic, and 1½ tsp. salt in a large bowl to combine. Add corn, avocados, chile, and cilantro to vinaigrette and toss to combine; season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing in direct contact with salad to prevent avocados from turning brown. Chill at least 2 hours.

### Do Ahead
Salad can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
