## Ingredients
3 pounds carrots with tops, scrubbed, tops trimmed to 1 inch
2 bunches spring onions or scallions, tops trimmed, halved lengthwise
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
Kosher salt
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 serrano chile, finely chopped, plus more sliced for serving
1 cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt
¼ cup fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons chopped mint, plus leaves for serving

### Special Equipment
A spice mill or mortar and pestle

## Process
Prepare a grill for medium-low heat. Toss carrots and spring onions on a rimmed baking sheet with 2 Tbsp. oil; season with salt. Grill (covered if possible), turning often and moving to a cooler part of the grill if they are browning too quickly, until crisp-tender, 15–20 minutes.

Meanwhile, toast cumin in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing often, until slightly darkened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Let cool; grind in spice mill or with mortar and pestle. Mix in a medium bowl with chopped serrano, yogurt, lime juice, chopped mint, and remaining 2 Tbsp. oil; season with salt.

Spoon yogurt onto a platter; arrange carrots and onions over. Top with mint leaves and sliced chile.

### Do Ahead: 
Yogurt can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.
