[Cheesy Spinach and Artichoke Pinwheels - Damn Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2017/09/27/cheesy-spinach-and-artichoke-pinwheels/)

## Ingredients
1 (14-ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
2 cups baby spinach, chopped
1 cup sour cream
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
2 (8-ounce) tubes crescent rolls
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

## Process
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly oil a pie plate or coat with nonstick spray.

In a large bowl, combine artichoke hearts, spinach, sour cream, mayonnaise, garlic powder and onion powder; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in mozzarella and Parmesan.

Unroll crescent rolls, pressing perforations to seal into approximately a 13Ã—18-inch rectangle. Top with artichoke mixture.

Starting at the shortest side, roll up, pressing the edges to seal. Cut in eighths. Place, cut side down, onto the prepared pie plate. Brush with egg.

Place into oven and bake until golden brown, about 15-20 minutes.

Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.
