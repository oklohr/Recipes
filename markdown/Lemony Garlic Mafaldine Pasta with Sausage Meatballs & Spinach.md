[Lemony Garlic Mafaldine Pasta with Sausage Meatballs & Spinach](https://dennistheprescott.com/2018/09/13/lemony-garlic-mafaldine-pasta-with-sausage-meatballs-spinach/)

## Ingredients
1 pound best quality pork sausage, casings removed
½ medium onion, finely diced
1 pound dried mafaldine pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
Zest of 1 lemon
250 grams baby spinach leaves
⅔ cup heavy (whipping) cream
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, plus more for grating
¼ cup fresh basil leaves
Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper

## Process
Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil, and cook the pasta according to package directions (al dente, please). (Also! Reserve 1/2 cup of cooking liquid when draining)

Meanwhile, divide the sausage mixture into small ½ tablespoon portions, then shape into meatballs. Awesome. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the meatballs and cook until cooked through and browned on all sides, about 6 – 7 minutes. Remove meatballs with a slotted spoon and set aside.

Pour the remaining oil into the pan and add the onions. Season with a pinch of salt, then cook until softened and translucent, 5 – 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, keeping watch that it doesn’t burn. Stir in the spinach and cook for 1 – 2 minutes, until wilted, then add the cream, lemon zest, cheese, and sausage meatballs. Season with a pinch of salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 4 – 5 minutes, until thickened, then add the butter to melt, and give everything a toss to mix. (If necessary, loosen the sauce with the reserved cooking liquid. Pro tip.)

Toss the cooked pasta with that beautiful creamy sauce, then garnish with fresh basil leaves and more Parmesan cheese.
