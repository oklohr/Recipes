## Ingredients
### COOKIES
1 stick (1/2 cup) salted butter, at room temperature
1/3 cup dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 large egg, at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup + 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

### CRINKLE TOP BROWNIES
1 cup Nutella
2 large eggs
4 tablespoons salted butter, melted
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chunks (optional)
flaky sea salt

## Process
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8x8 inch square baking dish and line it with parchment paper.

In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter, brown sugar, and sugar until combined. Add the egg, beating until combined and creamy. Beat in the vanilla. Add the flour, and baking soda, beat until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips. Press the dough into the prepared baking dish in an even layer.

To make the brownies. In a medium bowl, whisk together the Nutella, eggs, butter, and vanilla until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the flour and mix until just combined, 1 to 2 minutes more. Fold in the chocolate chunks (if using). Evenly spread the batter over the cooker layer. Transfer to the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Then cover the pan with foil and continue baking another 10-15 minutes, until the brownies are just set. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and let cool.

Eat warm (a little messy, but delicious) or let cool and store in an airtight container for up to 5 days. ENJOY!
