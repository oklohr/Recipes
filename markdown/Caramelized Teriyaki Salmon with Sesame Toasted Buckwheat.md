1 1/2 pounds skin on salmon cut into filets
2-3 teaspoons sugar

### SESAME TOASTED BUCKWHEAT
1 cup raw buckwheat groats*
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoons peanut oil
2 teaspoons honey
juice + zest of 1 lime
1 teaspoon fresh ginger
1/2 hot house or english cucumber sliced thin
2 green onions sliced
1/3 cup fresh cilantro chopped

## Process
### SESAME TOASTED BUCKWHEAT
Bring 2 cups water to a boil, add the buckwheat and boil until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain. Add the buckwheat to a bowl and toss with the soy sauce, peanut oil, honey, lime zest + juice and ginger. Stir in the cucumber, green onions and cilantro. Keep warm and serve a long side the salmon.

### SALMON
In a bowl, whisk together the sake, rice vinegar, soy sauce and ginger. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the oil. Sprinkle the top of the fish with with the sugar. Once hot, add the salmon, skin side down. Sear for 2-3 minutes or until the skin is crisp. Carefully flip the salmon and cook another 2-3 minutes or until the salmon has caramelized slightly. Carefully remove the salmon from the pan.

Wipe the skillet clean of any grease and add the teriyaki sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil and cook for 3-5 minutes or until the sauce has reduced by a 1/3. Add the salmon, skin facing up. Cook two minutes and then remove from the heat. Serve the salmon along side the buckwheat and drizzled with the teriyaki sauce. EAT!

### RECIPE NOTES
You can also substitute soba noodles for the buckwheat, I did, and found them to be delicious!
