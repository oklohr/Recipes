[Sea Salt Herb Skillet Rolls](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/sea-salt-herb-skillet-rolls/)

## Ingredients
1 cup (240ml) whole milk, warmed to about 110°F
2 and 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 standard packet)
2 Tablespoons + 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar, divided
1 large Eggland’s Best egg, at room temperature
1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter, melted + slightly cooled and divided
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons each: dried rosemary, dried basil, & dried parsley
1 teaspoon garlic powder (or 1 and 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic)
3 cups (385g) bread flour ( [spoon & leveled](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2015/07/29/baking-basics-measuring-is-everything/) ), plus more for work surface
sea salt, for topping

## Process
Pour the warm milk into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Or, if you do not own a stand mixer, a regular large mixing bowl. Sprinkle yeast and 1/2 teaspoon sugar on top of the milk. Give it a light stir with a spoon and allow to sit for 5 minutes. The mixture should be frothy after 5 minutes. If not, start over with new yeast.

**If you do not have a mixer, you can mix by hand in this step.** With the stand mixer running on low speed, add the remaining sugar, egg, 2 Tablespoons butter, salt, herbs, garlic powder, and 2 cups of flour. Beat on low speed for 1 minute, then add remaining 1 cup of flour. Beat on low speed for 1 minute as it all combines. The dough should be thick, yet soft. And only slightly sticky. It should pull away from the sides of the bowl as it mixes. When it does, it is ready to knead. If, however, the dough is too sticky to handle— add more flour, 1 Tablespoon at a time. Make sure you do not add too much extra flour; you want a soft, slightly sticky dough.

Form dough into a ball and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for 2 minutes, then place into a greased bowl— I usually just use olive oil or nonstick spray. Turn the dough over to coat all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in a warm environment to rise until doubled, about 2 hours. For this warm environment, I preheat the oven to 200°F (93°C) then turn the oven off and place the bowl inside the warm-ish oven.

Once doubled in size, punch down the dough to release any air bubbles. Remove dough from the bowl and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Punch down again to release any more air bubbles if needed. Using a sharp knife, cut the dough in half.Cut each half into 6 equal pieces for a total of 12 pieces that are a little larger than golfball size. Shape into balls as best you can and arrange in a greased oven-proof skillet. Brush the rolls with remaining melted butter and sprinkle each with sea salt. (Do no discard any leftover melted butter, it’s amazing brushed on the rolls after they bake too!) Loosely cover the rolls with plastic wrap and allow to rise until doubled in size and puffy, about 30-45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).Bake the rolls for 25-28 minutes until the tops are golden brown.Serve warm.

Cover leftover rolls and keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 3 months, then thaw overnight in the refrigerator. Warm up in a 300°F (149°C) oven for 10 minutes.

## Notes
If using instant yeast, the rise time may be a little less.

You can use finely chopped fresh herbs instead, I would increase to 1 Tablespoon each. Play around with the amounts of herbs you use. These amounts produce a highly flavored herb roll.

**Make ahead tip/overnight:** After dough has risen for two hours in step 3, punch down the dough inside the mixing bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight or for up to 2days, then remove from the refrigerator and continue with step 4. OR freeze for up to 2 months, then allow to thaw overnight in the refrigerator and continue with step 4.
