[Spicy Beer Queso with Chorizo and Black Beans](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2013/05/spicy-beer-queso-with-chorizo-and-black-beans/)

## Ingredients
1/2 pound chorizo
1 large shallot, diced
1 small jalapeño, seeded and diced
1/2 red pepper, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups of your favorite beer
1 (8-ounce) block of cream cheese, softened
12 ounces of white cheddar cheese, freshly grated
sliced scallions + cilantro for topping

## Process
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Remove any casing from the chorizo and add to the skillet, using a wooden spoon to break apart the sausage until it is in crumbles. Cook until the fat is rendered and the sausage appears to be cooked through. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to drain. At this time, I used another paper towel and just wiped out the excess inside the skillet.

Keep the heat under the skillet around medium-low and add olive oil, peppers, shallot and garlic with a pinch of salt. Stir well to coat. Let cook until softened, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat up to medium and add beer. After a few minutes, stir in softened cream cheese and continue stirring until it’s melted. At first it will look crumbly and separated, but it will melt! Once it is creamy, add in the white cheddar, stirring again until melted and reducing the heat to low. Stir in the black beans and sausage, then remove from heat and serve immediately. Top with scallions and cilantro if desired.

This stays creamy for a good while but like any queso, will seize up after time as it cools. If you can sit it over heat (like in a fondue pot) it will be perfect (with a stir every now and then) but otherwise, it reheats beautifully in the microwave with some additional liquid (beer, water, broth, etc)!
