[Lemon Poppy Seed Cake with Citrus Honey Glaze. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/lemon-poppy-seed-cake/)

## Ingredients
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup honey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 eggs at room temperature
3/4 cup plain Greek Yogurt
1 tablespoon Meyer (or regular) lemon zest and 1/4 cup juice
1 1/4 cups all-purpose or white whole wheat flour (for GF see note)
1 cup almond flour/meal
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

### CITRUS HONEY GLAZE
2 tablespoons honey
1 Meyer or regular lemon
1 blood orange
3/4 cup powdered sugar, using more as needed

## Process
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9x5 inch loaf pan with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, honey, eggs, yogurt, vanilla, lemon zest, and juice, mix until smooth and creamy. Add the all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix until just combined, being sure the batter is completely mixed. Stir in the poppy seeds.

Pour the batter into the prepared bread pan. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Meanwhile, make the glaze. Remove the zest from the remaining lemon and the blood orange with a vegetable peeler in wide strips. Then thinly slice the strips. Alternately, you can just zest the lemon and orange on a Microplane.  

In a medium bowl, mix together the honey and about 1/4 cup lemon juice. Drizzle 1/2 the glaze over the warm cake. To the remaining glaze, add 1 tablespoon blood orange juice and the powdered sugar, whisk until smooth. Stir in 1/2 the lemon zest and 1/2 of the orange zest.  If needed, thin the glaze by adding additional citrus juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, until drizzly. 

Pour the glaze over the cake, letting it fall down the sides. Let set 5 minutes, slice and enjoy warm or at room temp.

### RECIPE NOTES
Storing: this bread keeps well for 3-4 days at room temperature. 

To Freeze: Bake as directed, cool each loaf completely, then tightly wrap in plastic wrap. Freeze in a freezer bag or freezer safe container for up to 4 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge, or on the counter for a few hours. 

Gluten Free Sub: Use an equal amount of your favorite gluten free flour blend in place of the all-purpose flour. I recommend Cup4Cup gluten free flour. Or use 1 cup coconut flour. Note I find best results using a GF flour all-purpose mix.
