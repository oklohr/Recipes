## Ingredients
1 cup raw walnuts
1/2 cup raw unsweetened coconut flakes
1 1/2 cups (about 10 ounces) pitted packed dates
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 pinch flaky sea salt

### CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
2 cups raw cashews
1 cup full fat coconut milk*
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon instant coffee powder
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4-1/2 cup real maple syrup
8 ounces dark chocolate
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter or almond butter

## Process
To soak the cashews. Place the cashews in medium pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil 2 minutes, then cover and remove from the heat. Let the cashews soak for at 30 minutes or up to overnight. Drain well. 

Meanwhile, make the crust. Line an 8-inch spring form pan with parchment paper. In a food processor, combine the walnuts, coconut, dates, cocoa powder, and a pinch of salt. Pulse until finely ground and the mix forms a ball, about 2-3 minutes. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan, making sure to pack it in tightly.

To make the mousse. Add the drained cashews, coconut milk, cocoa powder, instant coffee, vanilla, and maple syrup to a food processor or high powered blender. Pulse until smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides as needed, about 5 minutes. Taste, adding more maple syrup if needed to sweeten. Pour the mixture evenly over the crust. Press a piece of plastic wrap over the mousse. Transfer to the fridge and chill for at least 2 hours, or overnight.If you mouse is still pudding like, transfer to the freeze and freeze until firm.

In a small, microwave safe bowl, melt together the chocolate and peanut butter until smooth, about 30 second to 1 minute. Let cool 5 minutes and then spread the chocolate overtop the cake. Return to the fridge to set up, about 10 minutes or until ready to serve. 

Slice and serve! Keep the cake stored in the fridge (or in the freeze if your mousse is on the looser side*).

### Notes
It is important to use full fat coconut milk that is not too watery. You want to use the creamiest, thickest coconut milk. If you open your can of coconut milk and there is water, do not use the water, use the creamy white milk/cream that has separated from the water.

If your mousse is too thick, add 1-2 tablespoons additional coconut milk at a time to help it blend the mousse.

Depending on the consistency of your coconut milk, you may end up with a mousse that is thinner and will not set up as easy. If this is the case, keep the cake stored in the freezer. To serve, remove from the freezer 5 minutes before cutting. Run your knife under hot water, then wipe dry, and cut.
