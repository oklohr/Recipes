## Ingredients
**SAUCE**
1/2 cup soy sauce, low sodium
1/2 cup water
2 tbsp honey
2 tbsp rice vinegar
2 tbsp peanut butter, unsalted
2 tsp cornstarch
1 tsp sesame oil
2 large garlic cloves, crushed

**STIRFRY**
6 oz soba noodles (brown rice noodles would work too)
1.5 lbs boneless & skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced
2 large bell peppers, cut into thin strips
4 cups kale, coarsely chopped & packed
1/2 cup peanuts, unsalted
3 green onion sprigs, chopped
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes or to taste

## Process
Bring medium pot, filled half with water, to a boil. In the meanwhile, get all ingredients ready, most importantly, cut the chicken, chop vegetables and measure peanuts. In a medium bowl, whisk Sauce Ingredients and set aside.

Add soba noodles to a pot with boiling water and cook for 2 – 3 minutes or al dente, stirring constantly and making sure the noodles do not stick. Reserve about a cup of noodles’ water (starchy water is great for diluting the sauce), transfer noodles to a colander, rinse with cold water and leave to drain.

Preheat non-stick wok or large deep skillet on high heat and add chicken. Cook until golden brown, stirring occasionally. This should take about 10 minutes (depending how much water your chicken contains). Add 1/3 of prepared Sauce and stir constantly for a minute or until sauce thickens and coats the meat. Remove from heat and transfer a bowl. Set aside.

Rinse and dry wok/skillet and return to the stove, on high heat. Add bell peppers and stir fry until fragrant and some peppers are golden brown, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium and add kale, soba noodles, chicken and remaining sauce. Stir gently until mixed, about a minute and remove from heat. Sauce will thicken as it warms up. If noodles absorb too much sauce, add some reserved noodles’ water. Add peanuts, green onions and red peppers flakes. Serve hot.
