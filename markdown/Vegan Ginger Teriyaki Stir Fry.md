## Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 cups vegetables (broccoli, snap peas & zucchini pictured)
2 cups edamame shelled
1 tablespoon ginger finely chopped
1 clove garlic crushed

### Vegan Teriyaki Sauce
3 tablespoons reduced sodium soy sauce (tamari or coconut aminos may be subbed)
5 tablespoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 teaspoons corn starch
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
1 teaspoon sake (optional; mirin, sherry or white wine may be subbed)

## Process
Shake together all vegan teriyaki sauce ingredients and set aside.

Heat oil over medium heat in a large pan.

Add the vegetables and edamame. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened (but you still want them to be a bit crisp).

Give the vegan teriyaki sauce a good shake, then pour into the pan. Cook for 1-2 minutes until sauce is thickened and all veggies are coated.

Serve immediately over rice.
