## Ingredients
8 ounces medium pasta shells
6 slices bacon, diced
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 shallot, minced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped sage
1 1/4 cups half and half
1 cup whole milk
1 (15-ounce) can butternut squash puree*
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
10 ounces shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese, about 2 1/2 cups
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

## Process
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions; drain well.

Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes. Drain excess fat; transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.

Melt butter in the skillet. Add garlic and shallot, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.

Whisk in flour and sage until lightly browned, about 1 minute.

Gradually whisk in half and half, milk, butternut squash and Dijon. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced and slightly thickened, about 3-4 minutes.

Stir in pasta and cheese until melted, about 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Serve immediately, garnished with bacon and chives, if desired.

### Notes:
Sweet potato or pumpkin puree can be substituted.
