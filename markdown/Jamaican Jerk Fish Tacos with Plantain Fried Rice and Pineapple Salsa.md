## Ingredients
1 pound salmon left whole or cut into steaks
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon all-spice
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
salt + pepper
juice from 1 orange + lime
corn or flour tortillas warmed
plain greek yogurt for serving

### PINEAPPLE SALSA
1 ripe pineapple
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1-2 jalapenos seeded, + chopped (I used 2)
juice of 1 lime
1/3 cup fresh cilantro chopped
salt to taste

### PLANTAIN RICE
4 large ripe plantains
1/4 cup coconut oil
salt + pepper
1/2 cup cooked black beans
1/4 cup fresh cilantro chopped

## Process
Place the salmon in a 9x13 inch pyrex pan and rub with olive oil. In a small bowl, combine the cumin, chili powder, curry powder, all-spice, cayenne, cinnamon and a pinch of salt + pepper. Rub the spice mixture over the salmon. Drizzle over the orange juice and lime juice. Cover and place the salmon in the fridge while you prepare the rice and salsa.

### PINEAPPLE SALSA
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Rub the pineapple with coconut oil and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. Add the jalapeno. Roast for 20 minutes or until the pineapple is charred and caramelized. Turn the pineapple half way through cooking. Remove from the oven and let cool.

Once the pineapple is cool enough to handle, finely chop the pineapple and add to a bowl. Remove the seeds from the jalapeno, chop and add to the bowl with the pineapple. Stir in the lime juice, cilantro and a pinch of salt.

### PLANTAIN RICE
Remove the peels from the plantains and roughly chop them. Add the plantains to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped and the plantains resemble rice. You can finely chop the plantains as well.

Add the coconut oil to a large skillet set over medium heat. Once hot, add the plantain rice and fry until golden and crisp, about 3-5 minutes. Once golden, remove from the heat and season with salt + pepper. Stir in the black beans and cilantro. Keep warm.

### TO COOK THE FISH AND ASSEMBLE
Place a large cast iron skillet or grill pan on high heat, or preheat the grill to high.

Once hot, add the fish and cook until your desired doneness is reached. I cooked about 4 minutes per side. Remove from the heat. Using a fork, flake the salmon into pieces.

To assemble your tacos, add the plantain rice to the warmed corn or flour tortillas. Add the salmon and top with pineapple salsa and a dollop of yogurt if desired. Garnish with fresh cilantro and limes. EAT!
