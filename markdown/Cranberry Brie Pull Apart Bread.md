[Cranberry Brie Pull Apart Bread. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/cranberry-brie-pull-apart-bread/#bo-recipe)

## Ingredients
1 round loaf sourdough bread
4 tablespoons butter
2/3 cup raw pecans chopped
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 (16 ounce) wheel of brie, cubed
1 cup dried cranberries

## Process
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Slice the bread horizontally and vertically to create 1 inch cubes, being careful not to actually slice all the way through the bread.

In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons butter, the pecans and brown sugar. Use your hands to mix the butter into the pecans to create a crumble. Take the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and insert thin slices into the loaf of bread.

Place the loaf on a baking sheet and stuff the brie inside the bread, filling in all the spaces in between the cuts. Add the cranberries and pecans. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the brie is melted and gooey. Serve immediately.
