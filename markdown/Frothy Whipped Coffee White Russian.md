[Frothy Whipped Coffee White Russian. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/whipped-coffee-white-russian/)

## Ingredients
1 tablespoon hot water
1 tablespoon instant coffee powder
1 tablespoon honey or granulated sugar (see note)
2 ounces (1/4 cup) vodka
1 - 1 1/2 ounces (2-3 tablespoons) Kahlua
1-2 ounces (2-4 tablespoons) whole milk or nut milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Process
Combine the hot water, instant coffee, and honey in a bowl. Using an electric mixer, whip until fluffy and light, 2-3 minutes. Alternately, you can do this with a hand frother too.

Fill a glass with ice. Add the vodka, Kahlua, and a splash of vanilla. Stir. Pour the milk over and stir to combine. Spoon the whipped coffee overtop. Gently stir and enjoy!

### RECIPE NOTES
Sweeteners: I love the flavor of honey and it works well, but sugar does whip up prettier and smoother.

If you love a lot of Whipped Coffee on Top, use 2 tablespoons instant coffee, 2 tablespoons hot water, and 1-2 tablespoons sugar.
