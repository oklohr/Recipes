## Ingredients
1 lb. potato gnocchi (homemade or store bought)
1/2 lb. shiitake mushrooms roughly chopped
1/2 lb. white button mushrooms roughly chopped
2 tbsp. butter
2 garlic cloves minced
1 tsp. finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
2/3 cup white wine such as Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, White Zinfandel
1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese
chopped parsley to garnish

## Process
In a medium pot, bring water to boil. Add the gnocchi and cook according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.

While the gnocchi is cooking, melt the butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes, letting them brown nicely. Add garlic and rosemary and cook for another minute.

Add wine and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the wine is almost evaporated but there is still some liquid remaining. Add the gnocchi, stir everything gently and keep cooking for 5-7 minutes until the gnocchi brown slightly.

Remove pan from the heat and sprinkle feta cheese on top. Garnish the dish with some fresh chopped parsley. Enjoy!
