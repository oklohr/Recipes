[Ham, Egg & Cheese Breakfast Quesadillas Recipe - Damn Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2019/01/11/ham-egg-and-cheese-breakfast-quesadillas/)

## Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup diced ham
1 cup chopped broccoli florets
4 large eggs, lightly beaten
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 green onions, thinly sliced
4 4-inch whole wheat tortilla
1/2 cup shredded reduced fat cheddar cheese
1/2 cup raspberries
1/2 cup blueberries
4 tangerines, peeled and segmented

## Process
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in ham and broccoli until broccoli is tender and bright green, about 3-4 minutes.

Add eggs to the skillet and cook, stirring gently using a silicone or heat-proof spatula, until they just begin to set; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Continue cooking until thickened and no visible liquid egg remains, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in green onions.

Layer half of each tortilla with the egg mixture; sprinkle with cheese. Fold in half and place onto the prepared baking sheet.

Place into oven and bake until the cheese has melted, about 5-6 minutes.
