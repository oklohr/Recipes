## Ingredients
1 pie crust, homemade or store-bought
1 can (15 ounce) pumpkin puree
1/2 cup Land O Lakes® Heavy Whipping Cream
3 eggs
1/3 cup real maple syrup
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper

### MAPLE WHIPPED CREAM
1 cup Land O Lakes® Heavy Whipping Cream
2 tablespoons real maple syrup
1 vanilla bean, seeds removed
chai sugar, for sprinkling (optional)

## Process
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease an 8-inch pie plate with butter.

Fit the pie crust into the prepared pie plate. Line the crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights, beans or rice. Transfer to the oven and bake until crust is set, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove pie weights and continue to bake until the crust is golden, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Reduce the oven temp 325.

To make the pumpkin filling, mix together the pumpkin, heavy cream, eggs, maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, cloves, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl until combined. Pour the mixture into the baked crust.

Transfer the pie to the oven and bake for 50-55 minutes or until the center no longer jiggles. Remove from the oven and let cool, and then place in the fridge to cool completely.

Using an electric mixer, whip the cream until soft peaks form. Add the maple syrup and vanilla bean. Whip once more until combined and fluffy.

When ready to serve, top the tart with the maple cream and sprinkle with chai sugar, if desired.Slice and serve!
