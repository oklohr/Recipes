[5-Minute Gooey Molten Chocolate Mug Cake | HBH](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/single-lady-5-minute-gooey-molten-chocolate-mug-cake/)

## Ingredients
3 tablespoons coconut oil (or olive oil/canola oil)
1 egg, at room temperature
3 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2-4 tablespoons honey, maple syrup, or granulated sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon brewed coffee
1 ounce semi-sweet chocolate chunks, very roughly chopped

## Process
Melt the coconut oil in a (10-12 ounce) microwave-safe mug. Whisk in the egg, milk, vanilla, and honey until combined. Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt, stirring until just combined.

Spoon the coffee into the center of the batter and gently swirl it in. Do not fully incorporate the coffee. Place the chocolate chunks in the center of the batter.

Microwave on full power for 1 minute 45 second to 2 minutes (I always do 2 minutes). Dig your spoon deep into the cake to spoon up melted chocolate with every bite. Serve with ice cream. ENJOY.

### RECIPE NOTES
To Oven Bake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a 2 cup oven safe ramekin/mug or 2 muffin tins. Add the batter and bake 22-25 minutes. 

Microwave: every microwave is very different, so results may vary slightly. I have a 1200 watt microwave and found 2 minutes to be the perfect cooking time. You may need to cook 1 minute 45 seconds or 2 minutes 15 seconds. Start with 2 minutes. 

Coffee: if you prefer to not use coffee, use an equal amount of warm water.
