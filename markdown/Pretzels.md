## Ingredients
1 1/2 cups warm water
2 tbsp. light brown sugar
1 package dry active yeast
3 oz. unsalted butter, melted
2 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
4 1/2 - 5 cups all purpose flour
Vegetable oil
3 quarts water
3/4 cup baking soda
1 egg, beaten with 1 tbsp water
Coarse sea salt

## Process
Combine the water, sugar, yeast, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer and mix with the dough hook until combined. Let sit for 5 minutes.

Add the salt and flower and mix on low until combined. Increase the speed to medium and continue kneading until the dough is smooth and begins to pull away from the side of the bowl, about 3-4 minutes. If the dough appears too wet, add additional flour, one tablespoon at a time.

Remove the dough from the bowl, place on a flat surface and knead into a ball with your hands.

Oil a bowl with vegetable oil, add the dough and turn to coat with the oil.

Cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap and place in a warm spot until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 425Ëš.

Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a small roasting pan over high heat and add the baking soda.

Remove the dough from the bowl and place on a flat surface.

Divide dough into 8 equal pieces, about 4 1/2 oz. each.

Roll each piece into a long rope and shape into lengths or shapes that you want.

Boil the pretzels in the water solution in batches. Boil for about 30 seconds. Remove with slotted spoon.

Place pretzels on baking sheet that has been sprayed with cooking spray. Make sure they are not touching.

Brush the tops with the egg wash and season liberally with salt.

Place into the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes until golden brown.

Add additional toppings immediately after removing from oven.
