Stir in the gnocchi and 1/3 cup water. Bring the sauce to a boil and cook another 5-10 minutes. Remove from the heat and remove the bay leaf and oregano. Top the dish with cheese. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes or until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese has melted. Top with fresh basil. Enjoy!
