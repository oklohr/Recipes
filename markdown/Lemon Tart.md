## Ingredients
8 full size graham cracker sheets (about 1 cup once crushed into crumbs)
1 cup salted pretzel twists
6 tablespoons salted butter, melted
2 tablespoons + 1/3 cup honey
3 1/2 cups heavy cream
2 tablespoons lemon zest + 1/3 cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups mixed fresh berries

## Process
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

To make the crust. In a food processor, pulse the graham crackers and pretzels into semi-fine crumbs. Add the butter and 2 tablespoons honey and pulse until the mixture holds together when pinched and starts to look like dough. Press the dough into an 8 or 9 inch tart pan with a removable bottom to form a flat, even crust. Transfer to the oven and bake until toasted, about 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine the heavy cream, remaining 1/3 cup honey, and lemon zest in a large pot, bigger than you think you'll need. Set over high heat and bring to a boil. Once boiling, boil 5 minutes and then remove from the heat and whisk in the lemon juice, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Let cool 10 minutes.

Carefully pour the lemon cream into the baked crust. Cover and chill 1 hour or until set. Before serving, remove the tart from the pan and top with fresh berries.
