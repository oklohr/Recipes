## Ingredients
2 sticks (1 cup) salted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups + 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 cups old fashioned oats
1 1/2 cups shredded unsweetened coconut
1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2-1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chunks
1 cup mini pretzel twists, crushed
flaky sea salt, for sprinkling

## Process
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until combined. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, until combined. Add the vanilla, beating until creamy. Add the flour, cinnamon (if using), baking soda, and salt. Fold in the oats, coconut, chocolate chips, and chocolate chunks.

Roll the dough into rounded 2 tablespoon size balls. Place 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Gently push a few crushed pretzel pieces into each dough ball (see above photo), then flatten the dough ball down with the palm of your hand to 1/2 inch thickness.

Transfer to the oven and bake for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and tap the baking sheet on the counter 3 times to flatten them down. Return to the oven and bake another 4 minutes or until the cookies are just beginning to set on the edges, but still doughy in the center. Remove from the oven and tap the baking sheet on the counter 2-3 times to flatten them down again. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet. They will continue to cook slightly as they sit on the baking sheet. Sprinkle with flaky salt.

Eat warm (highly recommended) or let cool and store in an airtight container for up to 4 days. 

### RECIPE NOTES
Freezing: the cookie dough balls can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw, then bake as directed.
