[Spicy Cucumber Margarita. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/spicy-cucumber-margarita/#bo-recipe)

## Ingredients
4-6 cucumber slices
4 fresh mint leaves (optional)
2 ounces silver tequila
1/2 ounce orange liquor (or 2 teaspoons orange zest, see note)
juice from 1/2 lime juice
1-2 jalapeño slices
2 teaspoons honey or sugar, using more or less to your taste
ginger beer, for topping (optional)

### CHILI SALT
1/4 cup pink sea salt or flaky sea salt
1 teaspoon chipotle chili powder
1 pinch granulated sugar
fresh thyme leaves (optional)

## Process
To make the chili salt. Combine the salt, chili powder, and sugar on a shallow plate. Rim your glasses in salt, then fill with ice.

In a cocktail shaker or glass jar, add cucumbers, mint (if using), tequila, orange liquor, lime juice, and honey or sugar. Muddle together, squashing everything to release the juices. Add the jalapeño slices. Fill with ice and shake until combined, about 1 minute, the longer you shake, the spicier it will be.

Strain into your prepared glass. Top with ginger beer, if desired. Garnish as desired with cucumbers and thyme, if desired. Enjoy!

### RECIPE NOTES
If you don't have orange liquor at home, you either omit this (I often do) or use 2 teaspoons orange zest or a a splash of orange juice.
