## Ingredients
1/4 pound bacon strips, cut into thirds
2 medium onions, halved and thinly sliced
2 medium apples, peeled and thinly sliced
1 package (9 ounces) ready-to-serve roasted chicken breast strips
1/4 cup jalapeno pepper jelly
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley

## Process
In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove to paper towels with a slotted spoon. Saute onions and apples in drippings until tender. Stir in the chicken, jelly, thyme and salt.

On a lightly floured surface, unfold puff pastry. Roll into a 10-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Transfer to a 15x10x1-in. parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Prick with a fork.

Spread chicken mixture over pastry to within 1 in. of edges. Sprinkle with cheese and pepper. Press edges with a fork, forming a decorative border.

Bake at 425Â° for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with bacon; bake 5-10 minutes longer or until golden brown. Sprinkle with parsley.
