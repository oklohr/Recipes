[Lemon Butter Cheese Ravioli with Garlic Basil Breadcrumbs. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/lemon-butter-cheese-ravioli/#bo-recipe)

## Ingredients
6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 cup Panko breadcrumbs (see note)
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped or grated
3/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
3/4 cup fresh basil, finely chopped (or 3 tablespoons dried basil)
1 pound cheese ravioli homemade or store-bought
4 tablespoons salted butter
1 bunch asparagus, chopped
2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves (or 1 tablespoon dried thyme)
zest and juice of 1 lemon
3/4 cup dry white wine (or low sodium broth)
kosher salt and black pepper
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes

## Process
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, the breadcrumbs, and basil. Cook, stirring occasionally until the breadcrumbs are toasted all over, about 3 minutes. Add the cheese and cook another 2 minutes, until fried. Remove the breadcrumbs from the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Set the breadcrumbs aside.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli according to package directions until al dente. Drain the ravioli.

Place the skillet back over medium heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and the asparagus. Cook until tender, about 3-5 minutes. Add the butter, 1 clove garlic, the thyme, and lemon zest, and cook until the butter begins to brown, 3-4 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add the wine and lemon juice. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes. Simmer 2-3 minutes, until the sauce reduces slightly. Drop the ravioli into the sauce, gently tossing to combine.

Divide the ravioli between plates. Top with breadcrumbs and additional herbs, if desired. Enjoy!

### RECIPE NOTES
To Make Fresh Breadcrumbs: Pulse torn bread in a food processor until roughly the size of peppercorns. I like to use ciabatta or crusty sourdough bread. If using fresh crumbs, toast them 3-4 minutes in the skillet first.
