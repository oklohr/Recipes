[Butternut Squash Alfredo Pasta - Damn Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2017/10/13/butternut-squash-alfredo-pasta/)

## Ingredients
12 ounces cavatappi pasta
3 slices bacon, diced
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole milk
1 1/2 cups butternut squash puree
1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage
1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon
3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
1/4 cup heavy cream
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 cups leftover diced rotisserie chicken

## Process
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions; drain well.

Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes; drain excess fat. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.

Melt butter in the skillet. Add garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk. Cook, whisking constantly, until incorporated, about 1-2 minutes.

Stir in butternut squash, sage and Dijon. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in Parmesan and heavy cream until incorporated; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Stir in pasta and chicken, and gently toss to combine.

Serve immediately, garnished with bacon and sage, if desired.
