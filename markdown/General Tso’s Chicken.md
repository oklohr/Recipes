[General Tso, I love your chicken. | Dennis The Prescott](https://dennistheprescott.com/2015/04/15/general-tso-i-love-your-chicken/)

## Ingredients
1 1/2lbs chicken breast
1/4 cup flour
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup breadcrumbs
1 cup panko
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
1/3 cup hoisin sauce
1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
3 tablespoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 cup red chilis
1/3 cup green onions
2 tablespoons sesame seeds

## Process
Preheat your oven to 450.

Top a baking tray with a rack.

Cut your chicken into 1 inch chunks. Prepare 3 bowls, 1 with your flour, 1 with your eggs, and one with the breadcrumbs & panko. Working in batches, roll the chicken in the flour, then the eggs, and finally in the breadcrumbs, getting them completely coated.

Bake for 15 minutes, turning halfway through.

In a large saucepan, combine your stock, hoisin, soy, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, and corn starch, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, drop in your chilis. After 3 minutes, add your chicken, and toss to get the chicken covered. Remove from the heat, and toss in your green onions.

Serve up with some rice, and top your chicken with sesame seeds.
