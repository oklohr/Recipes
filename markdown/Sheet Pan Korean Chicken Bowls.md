2-3 cups kale, roughly torn

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. On a rimmed baking sheet, toss the sweet potatoes with 1 tablespoon oil, salt, and pepper. Transfer to the oven and roast for 20 minutes.

To make the Gochujang sauce. In a glass jar, combine the soy sauce, Gochujang, honey, ginger, garlic, 1 tablespoon oil, and the sesame seeds.

Add the chicken to a bowl and toss with half of the Gochujang sauce. Remove the potatoes from the oven and slide them to 1 side of the pan. Add the chicken and any sauce left in the bowl to the other side. Return to the oven and continue roasting another 15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. During the last 2-3 minutes of cooking, switch the oven to broil and broil until the chicken chars on the edges and the sauce sticks to the chicken. Watch closely, the broiler can burn food fast.

Meanwhile, combine 2-3 tablespoons of the remaining Gochujang sauce with the yogurt. Season with salt. This is the "yum yum" sauce. Reserve any remaining Gochujang sauce for serving.

In a bowl, toss the kale with 1 tablespoon oil, the lime juice, and a pinch of salt. Toss in the cilantro.

To serve, divide the rice between bowls. Top with chicken, potatoes, kale, and avocado. Add additional toppings as desired. Serve drizzled with the "Yum Yum" sauce.
