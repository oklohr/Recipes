[Pumpkin Cake Donuts](https://damndelicious.net/2018/10/24/pumpkin-cake-donuts/) 

## Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup granulated sugar, divided
1/2 cup dark brown sugar, packed
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 large eggs
1 cup canned pumpkin puree
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted

## Process
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a donut pan with nonstick spray.

In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, salt and baking soda.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat 1/2 cup granulated sugar, brown sugar and vegetable oil on medium-high until well combined, about 1-2 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until well combined. Beat in pumpkin and vanilla until just combined. Gradually add flour mixture to sugar mixture at low speed, beating just until incorporated.

Using a piping bag fitted with a round piping tip or a large Ziplock bag with the corner cut off, pipe the batter evenly into the donut pan. Place into oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until donuts are slightly browned and spring back when touched.

In a medium bowl, combine remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar and cinnamon.

When the donuts are done, cool for 10 minutes and brush the tops with butter, gently tossing in the cinnamon sugar mixture.
