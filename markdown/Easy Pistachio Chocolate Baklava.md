## Ingredients
2 cups pistachios, roasted, salted, and roughly chopped
1 cup almonds, roasted or raw, and roughly chopped
1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
24 sheets frozen phyllo dough, thawed (about 1/2 a pound)
1 stick salted butter, melted
1 cup honey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

## Process
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9 inch spring form pan with parchment paper.

In a medium bowl, combine the pistachios, almonds, chocolate chips, and cinnamon.

Fold 1 sheet of phyllo dough in half and then place in the prepared pan. Brush the phyllo dough with melted butter. Repeat, layering 8 more times, placing the sheets of dough over top of each other. Spoon half of the nut/chocolate mix over the dough. Now add another 8 sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter. Spoon over the remaining filling. Add another 8 sheet of phyllo, agin brushing each with butter. 

Cut the baklava into 8 triangles. Place the pan on a baking sheet and transfer to the oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, until phyllo is golden brown. 

Meanwhile, combine 1/2 cup water and the honey in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer 5 minutes until thickened slightly. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Pour the syrup over the warm baklava and let soak for 2 hour or overnight. Enjoy!
