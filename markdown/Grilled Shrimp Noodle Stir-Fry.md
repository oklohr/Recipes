## Ingredients
1 lb Jumbo (or tiger) Shrimp
400 grams egg noodles
1 large green zucchini (about 2 cups), julienned
1 large red pepper, julienned
1 cup snap peas
2 green onions, diced
2 â€“ 3 red chillies, finely diced
1/2 cup cashews, roughly chopped
1 tablespoon sesame oil

### For the marinade
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
1 garlic clove, minced
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon Gochujang
1 teaspoon ginger, grated
2 tablespoons green onions, finely diced
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon lime zest

## Process
Combine all of your marinade ingredients in a bowl and mix together. Pour the marinade into a freezer baggie, and add your shrimp. Place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and cook your noodles according to the package directions. Drain and set aside.

Heat a grill pan over medium high. Working in batches, grill your shrimp (reserving the marinade in the freezer baggie) for 1 1/2 minutes per side.

Heat a work (or large frying pan) over medium high. When hot, add 1 tablespoon and your veggies. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, and pour in marinade, and bring to a boil. When the sauce comes to a boil, add your noodles, cashews, and shrimp, and combine.

Serve up your noodles and top with diced red chillies and green onions.
