## Ingredients
1 1/2 poundsNew York strip steak, cut into 1 1/4-inch cubes
1 large red onion, cut into 1 1/4-inch cubes
1 pound [halved baby potatoes, parboiled](https://www.thekitchn.com/why-you-should-boil-potatoes-before-grilling-tips-from-the-kitchn-205399) 
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
8 (10-inch) skewers (soaked for at least 30 minutes if wooden)
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
4 cloves garlic, crushed

## Process
Heat a grill to high, direct heat.

Toss the steak, onion, potatoes, olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Thread onto the skewers, about 9 pieces per skewer.

Melt the butter in a small saucepan on the grill. Add the garlic and simmer until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the garlic butter from the grill.

Oil the grill grates. Place the skewers on the grill, cover, and cook until the beef is seared and cooked to desired doneness, 4 to 5 minutes per side, occasionally brushing both sides of the skewer with the garlic butter.
