[Spicy Chicken Vegetable Stir Fry by Karylâ€™s Kulinary Krusade](https://karylskulinarykrusade.com/recipe-spicy-chicken-vegetable-stir-fry/)

## Ingredients
10 ounces boneless, skinless chicken thighs, diced into bite-sized pieces
1 1/2 tablespoons avocado oil or canola oil
2 cloves raw garlic, sliced thinly
1/4 cup yellow onion, sliced
1/2 cup green beans, sliced at an angle into 2-3 pieces
10 spears asparagus (hard ends removed), cut into 2" slices
1 cup broccoli florets
1/2 cup snow peas, sliced in half
1 teaspoon cornstarch

### Marinade
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons raw honey
2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce (more or less, to taste)
1 teaspoon ground chili with fried garlic (more or less, to taste)
2 cloves garlic, minced

## Process
Combine marinade ingredients (soy sauce, honey, Sriracha, ground chili with fried garlic, and garlic) in a medium bowl. Add chicken, and marinate in fridge for 30 minutes.  Drain marinade into small saucepan.

Add 1/2 tablespoon oil to wok or skillet and heat over medium-low heat. Add sliced garlic and saute about 3 minutes, until golden brown. Remove garlic and set aside.

Add onions to wok, and saute about 5 minutes, until golden. Remove onions and add to garlic.

Add 1 tablespoon oil to wok or skillet, and turn heat to medium-high. When oil begins to sizzle, add green beans, broccoli, and asparagus. Saute for about 5 minutes, tossing occasionally. 

Add snow peas, onion and garlic to wok or skillet, and saute for another 2-3 minutes. Move all vegetables to the side, creating an open space in the middle.

Add chicken to center of wok or skillet. Saute chicken about 4 minutes per side, until chicken is cooked through. 

While the chicken cooks, cook marinade over low heat for 5-10 minutes. Add cornstarch to cooked marinade, and whisk to thicken

Turn heat to low, and add cooked marinade a little at a time, tossing well in between. You may not need all of the marinade.

### Notes
DO NOT ADD RAW, USED MARINADE TO STIR FRY! Two options:
	Add marinade to a small saucepan and cook it for 5-10 minutes
	Make double the marinade, immediately reserve half, and cook that marinade in a small 		saucepan.

Sambal Chili Paste is an alternative to Ground Chili with Fried Garlic. Find it in the Asian foods aisle of the grocery store

Mix it up, and use your favorite vegetables.

Cut vegetables approximately the same size so they cook evenly. Add more sturdy vegetables first, as they take a little longer to cook
