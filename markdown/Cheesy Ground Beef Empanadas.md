## Ingredients
1 lb ground beef
1 medium onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 tsp ground cumin
1 1/2 tsp garlic salt
1 tsp Slap Ya Mama® seasoning
1 tsp pepper
1 tsp oregano
1/2 tsp crushed red peppers
1/4 tsp chili powder
8 oz can tomato sauce
1 Tbsp diced jalapeños
1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese, grated
1/2 cup Monterey Jack cheese, grated
2 boxes Pillsbury™ Refrigerated Pie Crust
1 egg

## Process
Preheat oven to 425°.

In a cast iron pan or large frying pan, add ground beef, chopped onions, minced garlic and cook over medium heat until ground beef is no longer pink. Drain grease and return to pan.

Sprinkle with seasonings, stir. 

Add tomato sauce and jalapeños, stir and let simmer for 15 minutes.

Unroll pie crust on a lightly flour surface. Using a 4 inch bowl, turn bowl upside down and press down to cut dough. Should be able to get 4 pieces per pie crust.

Add a little water to the edges of the dough before filling to help seal.

Add a small amount of shredded cheese and about a 1/4 cup of meat mixture.

Fold dough over and using a fork, close up the edges by pressing to seal and place on a baking sheet.

In a small bowl, whisk egg and one tablespoon of water together. Using a basting brush, brush egg wash over the top of each empanada. 

Bake for 15 minutes or until empanada crust is golden brown.

Carefully remove from oven and enjoy.
