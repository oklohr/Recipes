## Ingredients
2 small sweet potatoes, cut into 1/4 inch rounds
1 yellow onion, sliced
1 red or orange bell pepper, sliced
6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
kosher salt and black pepper for seasoning
4 salmon fillets (5-6 ounces)
2 teaspoons chipotle chili powder
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
2-4 cloves garlic, minced or grated, to your taste
the zest + juice from 1 lime
2-3 cups kale, spinach or arugula, roughly torn
2-3 cups cooked quinoa or brown rice
avocado, tortilla chips, feta cheese, for serving

### ROASTED JALAPEÑO SPECIAL SAUCE
1 jalapeño, seeded if desired
1/2 cup plain greek yogurt, olive oil mayo, or sour cream
juice of 1-2 limes, to your taste
2 teaspoons honey
1 cup cilantro, roughly chopped
1 pinch kosher salt

## Process
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. On a rimmed baking sheet, toss the potatoes, onions, bell pepper, and jalapeño pepper with 3 tablespoons olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast for about 20 minutes, or until tender. 

Place the salmon on a plate and rub with chipotle chili powder, paprika, garlic, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, rubbing the seasonings and oil evenly into each filet. 

Remove the potatoes from oven and push them to one side of pan. Put the salmon on the other side. Return pan to oven and roast for 10 to 20 minutes more, until salmon reaches desired doneness and potatoes are soft. Remove from oven and zest the limes over the salmon.

To make the special sauce. De-seed the jalapeño, if desired. To a blender, add the yogurt, roasted jalapeño, juice of 2 limes, honey, and cilantro. Blend until smooth. Season with salt.

To serve, toss the greens with 1 tablespoon oil, a squeeze of lime, and a pinch of salt. Divide the quinoa or brown rice between bowls. Top with salmon, potatoes, onions, peppers, kale, and avocado. Add additional toppings as desired. Serve drizzled with the special sauce.

### TO MEAL PREP
Prepare as directed above through step 4. 

Divide the quinoa among 4-6 storage containers and arrange the salmon, sweet potatoes, onions, peppers, and kale on top. Add desired toppings, but leave off the avocado and chips. Store the special sauce, avocado, and chips separately and add just before serving. 

Alternately, you can store the salmon, quinoa, and veggies in separate containers and assemble when ready. Food will keep in the fridge for up to 4-5 days. 

Before serving, warm each bowl, if desired, and top with special sauce and avocado.
