[Cinnamon Sugar Pretzel Bites](https://damndelicious.net/2017/12/30/cinnamon-sugar-pretzel-bites/) 

## Ingredients
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 pounds pizza dough, store-bought or homemade, at room temperature
1/3 cup baking soda
1 large egg, beaten
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted

## Process
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a small bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon; set aside.

Working on a lightly floured surface, cut dough into 4 equal strips. Roll each strip into a long rope, about 12-14 inches; cut into 1-inch pieces.

Heat 6 cups water and baking soda in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil; working in batches, drop dough pieces until slightly puffed and dimpled, about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain well.

Place dough pieces onto the prepared baking sheet, about 1/2-inch apart. Brush with egg.

Place into oven and bake until golden brown, about 9-12 minutes.

Working in batches, combine warm pretzel bites, butter and cinnamon-sugar mixture until evenly coated.
