## Ingredients
**Sauce**
1/4 cup soy sauce (I used Bragg liquid aminos)
2 tbsp maple syrup or honey
1 tbsp cornstarch
5 garlic cloves, grated
1 inch ginger, grated
1 tsp salt
Ground black pepper, to taste

**Beef Stir Fry**
2 lbs beef sirloin, cut into 1 inch cubes
3 medium bell peppers, cut into 1 inch pieces
2 large zucchini, cut into quarters
9 oz snap (snow) peas
3/4 cup cashews, unsalted
2 tbsp toasted sesame or avocado oil, divided
3 large green onions, chopped

## Process
In a small bowl, whisk together Beef Stir Fry Sauce ingredients and set aside.
In a wok, toast cashews on medium heat until golden brown, stirring occasionally. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.

Return wok to high heat and add 1 tbsp sesame oil. Add beef and cook until brown and crispy, for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Move beef to a side of  the wok and add remaining sesame oil, bell pepper, zucchini and snap peas to the centre of the wok. Cook vegetables for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add cashews, pour sauce and stir. Cook stir fry until vegetables are tender and sauce has thickened, about 3 â€“ 5 minutes, stirring frequently.

Garnish with green onion and serve hot over brown rice, quinoa or noodles of choice.
