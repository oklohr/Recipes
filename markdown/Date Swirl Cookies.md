## Ingredients
### FILLING:
2 cups chopped dates
1 cup water
1 cup sugar
1 cup chopped nuts
2 teaspoons lemon juice

### DOUGH:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup sugar
3 large eggs, room temperature
1 teaspoon lemon extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon baking soda

## Process
In a saucepan, combine filling ingredients. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture becomes stiff, 15-20 minutes. Chill.

For dough, cream butter and sugars in a bowl. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add extract. Combine flour, salt and baking soda; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Chill for at least 1 hour.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of the dough to a 12x9-in. rectangle, about 1/4 in. thick. Spread with half of the filling. Roll up, starting with the long end. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Wrap in plastic; chill overnight.

Cut rolls into 1/4-in. slices. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375Â° for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
