[Green Bean Casserole with Crispy Fried Shallots - Damn Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2018/11/09/green-bean-casserole-with-crispy-fried-shallots/)

## Ingredients
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 shallot, minced
1 (8-ounce) package cremini mushrooms, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed and halved
2 cups freshly grated white cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup heavy cream
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1/2 cup Panko*

### FOR THE CRISPY FRIED SHALLOTS
2 cups canola oil
4 shallots, thinly sliced into 1/8-inch-thick rings
1/2 cup all-purpose flour

## Process
Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until it registers 325 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer.

Working in batches, dredge shallots in flour, separating the rings and coating them thoroughly; shake off excess flour.

Add shallots to the skillet, a handful at a time, and cook, stirring constantly, until evenly golden and crispy, about 2-4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Melt butter in a large oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Add shallot and mushrooms, and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and browned, about 5 minutes.

Stir in garlic, thyme and flour, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Stir in chicken stock, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes.

Str in green beans, and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, about 5-6 minutes.
Remove from heat; stir in 1 cup white cheddar cheese and heavy cream until smooth, about 1-2 minutes; season with salt and pepper to taste. Top with remaining 1 cup white cheddar cheese, Panko and shallots.

Place into oven and bake until golden brown and bubbly, about 25-30 minutes.
