## Ingredients
### Basic Crepes 
3 free range eggs
125 grams all purpose flour
250ml whole milk
Pinch of salt
Butter

### Maple Glazed Apples
2 tablespoons butter
3 large Royal Gala or Honeycrisp Apples
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons maple syrup

## Process
Combine the eggs, flour, milk, and a pinch of salt in the base of a blender, and blend until smooth. Run the batter through a strainer set overtop a bowl, to remove any lumps. Cover, and place in the fridge overnight.

The next day.

Heat a skillet over medium heat, and melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Peel and slice the apples into 1/2 inch wedges, and toss them in the cinnamon. Add the apples to the pan and sauté, turning every minute or so, for 6 – 8 minutes, until they have started to soften (you can check this by poking a knife into the center of an apple slice). Pour in the maple syrup, and cook for 3 minutes, stirring often. The syrup will bubble away and start to caramelize around the apples. Transfer to a dish and set aside.

Crepe time! Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat, and melt a small knob of butter (you want just enough butter to coat the entire surface of the pan that you’re using).

Pour in 1 ladle of batter, swirling the pan at the same time as you pour so that the batter coats the base of the pan. (With my pan, I pour in about 1/2 cup of batter, but how much batter that you need will depend on the pan size you’re rocking). Cook for 1 1/2 – 2 minutes, then flip and cook another 1 minute, or until golden brown on both sides.

Serve immediately with your apples. For next level action, add some more maple syrup, vanilla ice cream, and fresh fruit. Eat Delicious.
