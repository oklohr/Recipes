 [Creamy Shrimp Boil Pasta](https://damndelicious.net/2017/06/11/creamy-shrimp-boil-pasta/) 

## Ingredients
1 pound cavatappi pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (12.8-ounce) package smoked andouille sausage, thinly sliced
1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
3 teaspoons Old Bay Seasoning, divided
1/4 cup unsalted butter
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup vegetable broth, or more, as needed
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 cup corn kernels, frozen, canned or roasted
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

## Process
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions; drain well.

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add sausage, and cook, stirring frequently, until sausage is lightly browned, about 3-4 minutes; set aside and drain excess fat.

Season shrimp with 1 1/2 teaspoons Old Bay Seasoning. Add shrimp to the skillet, and cook, stirring occasionally, until pink, about 2-3 minutes; set aside.

Melt butter in the skillet. Add garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.

Gradually whisk in vegetable broth, heavy cream, Parmesan, thyme and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons Old Bay Seasoning. Cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 2-3 minutes. If the mixture is too thick, add more vegetable broth as needed; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Stir in pasta, sausage, shrimp and corn, and gently toss to combine.

Serve immediately, garnished with chives, if desired.
