## Ingredients
### VANILLA MASCARPONE ICE CREAM
4 ounces mascarpone cheese
1 cup sweetened condensed milk
2 cups heavy cream
2 teaspoons vanilla
pinch of flaky sea salt

### HONEY NUT CHEERIO GRANOLA
2 cups Honey Nut Cheerios
1 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup peanuts or cashews roughly chopped
1/2 cup honey
3 tablespoons coconut oil or butter
2 teaspoons vanilla
pinch of flaky sea salt

### GRILLED STONE FRUIT
3-4 peaches nectarines, plums or apricots, halved + pit removed
2-4 tablespoons butter melted
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
honey for serving

## Process
### VANILLA MASCARPONE ICE CREAM
Add the mascarpone and sweetened condensed milk to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or use a hand held electric mixer) and whip until smooth and combined. Add the heavy cream, vanilla and salt. Whip until stiff peaks form. Spoon the ice cream into a freezer safe container and freeze 4-6 hours or overnight.

### HONEY NUT CHEERIO GRANOLA
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

On the baking sheet, combine the Cheerios, oats and nuts. In a small saucepan, melt together the honey and coconut oil or butter. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla + salt. Pour the mix over the Cheerios and toss to combine. Place in the oven and bake for 10 minutes, toss and bake another 10 minutes or until the oats are golden. Remove and let cool.

### GRILLED STONE FRUIT
Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium high heat and brush the grates with oil.

In a bowl, toss together the fruit and butter. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Grill the fruit for 2-3 minutes or until light char marks appear, flip and grill another 2-3 minutes. Remove from the grill.

Serve the grilled fruit warm, with a large scoop of Vanilla Mascarpone Ice Cream and plenty of Honey Nut Cheerio Granola...then maybe even a drizzle of honey!
