## Ingredients
1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1/2 cup cornstarch
2 large eggs, beaten
1/4 cup vegetable oil

### FOR THE SAUCE
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice
Zest of 1 orange
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

## Process
In a large bowl, season shrimp with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in cornstarch and gently toss to combine. Working one at a time, dip the shrimp into the eggs.

Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan. Add shrimp and cook until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; discard excess oil.

To make the glaze, combine honey, orange juice, orange zest, garlic powder, red pepper flakes and ginger over medium low heat. Bring to a boil, simmering until thickened, about 1-2 minutes.

Serve shrimp immediately, tossed or drizzled with honey mixture, garnished with orange zest, if desired.
