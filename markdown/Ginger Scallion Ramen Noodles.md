## Ingredients
1 5-inch piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped (about ⅓ cup)
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 large bunch of scallions, very thinly sliced (about 2 cups), divided
½ cup grapeseed or other neutral oil
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
½ teaspoon sugar
Kosher salt
4 5-ounce packages wavy ramen noodles, preferably fresh
Toasted sesame seeds and chili oil (for serving)

## Process
Stir ginger, garlic, and two-thirds of scallions in a large bowl.

Heat grapeseed oil in a small saucepan over high until oil is shimmery and hot but not smoking, about 2 minutes. Pour hot oil over scallion mixture. The scallions will sizzle, turn bright green, and wilt almost immediately. Let sit 5 minutes before stirring in remaining scallions. Stir in soy sauce, vinegar, pepper, sesame oil, and sugar; season with salt. Let sit to let flavors meld, 15 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings.

Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and toss with as much or as little scallion sauce as you'd like in bowl.

Divide noodles among bowls. Top with sesame seeds and serve with chili oil alongside.
