[Blackberry Peekaboo Cookies Recipe | Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/blackberry-peekaboo-cookies/)

## Ingredients
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup shortening
2 cups packed brown sugar
2 large eggs, room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
1-1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1-1/2 teaspoons salt
3/4 cup seedless blackberry spreadable fruit

## Process
Cream butter, shortening and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add 1 egg at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. In another bowl, whisk flour, baking soda and salt; gradually beat into creamed mixture. Divide dough in half. Shape each into a disk; cover. Refrigerate until firm enough to roll, about 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350Â°. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion of dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with a floured 2-in. round cookie cutter. Place half of the circles onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Spread 1 teaspoon spreadable fruit in the center of each circle; top with remaining circles, pressing edges lightly to seal.

Bake until light brown, 10-12 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
