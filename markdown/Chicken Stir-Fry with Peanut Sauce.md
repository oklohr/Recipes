## Ingredients
2 teaspoons dark sesame oil, divided
	**Note: typically need more than this.**
1 pound chicken cutlets, trimmed
2 cups broccoli florets
1 large red bell pepper, sliced
1/4 cup light coconut milk
2 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
1 tablespoon Sriracha
2 teaspoons grated lime rind
1 tablespoon lime juice
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 cup unsalted cashews

## Process
Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add 1 teaspoon oil; swirl to coat. Add chicken; cook 1 minute on each side. Remove chicken from pan; cut into thin slices. Add broccoli and bell pepper to pan; stir-fry 4 minutes or until vegetables are lightly browned.

Reduce heat to medium-high. Combine remaining 1 teaspoon oil, coconut milk, and next 7 ingredients (through cumin) in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk. Add chicken and coconut milk mixture to pan; cook 30 seconds. Sprinkle evenly with cashews.
