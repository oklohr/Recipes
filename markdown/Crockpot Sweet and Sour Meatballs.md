[Crock Pot Sweet & Sour Meatballs | The Country Cook](https://www.thecountrycook.net/crock-pot-sweet-sour-meatballs/)

## Ingredients
1 28 oz bag Johnsonville Frozen Homestyle Meatballs
1 20 oz can pineapple chunks in 100% juice save juice
1 green pepper diced
1 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup vinegar
2 tbsp soy sauce
3 tbsp cornstarch

## Process
First, drain the juice from your can of pineapple into a medium bowl (you'll need that later for the sauce.) It should give you about a cup of pineapple juice.
Place frozen meatballs into your 4-6 quart crock pot, then top meatballs with pineapple chunks and green peppers.

Add brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce and cornstarch to the pineapple juice you set aside. Whisk it all together well.

Pour sauce over meatballs, cover and cook on low for 2 hours.

After a couple of hours, switch your crock pot to high and cook for an additional hour. Doing this will thicken the sauce. The sauce should be thicker and bubbling around the edges.
