[Garlic Butter Shrimp with Asparagus â€” Eatwell101](https://www.eatwell101.com/category/healthy-cooking-tips-cook-guide-how-to-cook-well)

## Ingredients
1.5 lbs (700g) medium raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
1.5 (700g) asparagus (1 bunch) rinsed and trimmed
3 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
5 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 teaspoons onion powder
Salt and fresh cracked pepper, to taste
1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable stock
1 tablespoon Sriracha (or any hot sauce you like)
Crushed chili pepper flakes, optional
Juice of 1/2 lemon
Fresh chopped parsley or cilantro, for garnish

## Process
Place a large non-stick skillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add the asparagus and season to taste. Saute until the asparagus is crisp-tender, 4-6 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.

In the same pan, add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and add shrimp. Season with salt and pepper, cook 1-2 minutes on one side.

Add the minced garlic, Italian seasoning, and onion powder. Stir to combine and flip the shrimp to cook on the opposite side.
Cook for 1 minute then add 1/4 cup vegetable stock and Sriracha. Allow the sauce to reduce for 1 minute, making sure not to overcook the shrimp.

Push shrimp on the side and add asparagus back to the pan. Stir asparagus to coat them into the sauce and squeeze half of a lemon over the top of the shrimp and asparagus. Allow reheating for 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat, garnish with parsley, lemon slices, and red crushed chili pepper if you like. Serve the shrimp and asparagus immediately, enjoy!

### Notes:
You can save time when cooking asparagus by blanching them first in boiling water for 2 minutes then soak in ice water to stop cooking. Then you can saute asparagus as per the recipe, but quicker to get asparagus crisp-tender.

Try as much as possible to buy wild caught shrimp. Look for medium to large-sized shrimp, because they tend to stay juicier.
