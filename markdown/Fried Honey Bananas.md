## Ingredients
1 tablespoon coconut oil (olive oil works too!)
1 slightly under-ripened banana
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon cinnamon

## Process
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Slice banana into about 1/4 inch thick slices.

Fry bananas for 2 minutes on each side, occasionally lifting to prevent sticking.

Whisk together honey and water. Remove pan from heat and pour honey and water over bananas.

Top with cinnamon.
