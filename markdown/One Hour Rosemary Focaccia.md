## Ingredients
¾ cup warm water (heat in the microwave for 10 seconds and stir — it should be just lukewarm)
½ teaspoon sugar
1½ teaspoons yeast (1/4 ounce package such as Fleischmann’s Rapid Rise)
5 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour, divided (plus more for sprinkling the dough)
1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
1 tablespoon freshly grated parmesan (optional)
1 clove garlic, finely chopped (optional)
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried, divided
flaky sea salt for topping (optional)

## Process 
Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Grease a cast iron skillet or 8 – 9″ cake pan with 1/2 tablespoon of the olive oil.

Place the warm water and sugar in the mixing bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (you can use an electric handheld mixer as well). Stir well to combine.

Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir just a bit. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

Turn the mixer on low speed, and add 1 cup of the flour and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and mix just until combined.

Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and 1/2 tablespoon of the fresh rosemary or 1 teaspoon dried and mix until combined.

With the mixer on low, gradually add 1/2 cup of the remaining flour, then add just enough of the remaining 1/4 cup until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl (you may not need it all).

Lightly flour countertop with flour. Remove the dough and place onto the floured surface and sprinkle the top lightly with flour as well. Gently shape the dough into a flat disk and place in the prepared skillet.

Gently press the dough evenly in the bottom of the skillet and 1″ up the sides, then cover with a clean towel.

**TURN OFF THE OVEN**and place the skillet in the oven for 20 minutes to rise.

Remove the skillet from the oven and remove the towel. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt, garlic, and remaining rosemary.

Brush the olive oil mixture over the focaccia bread dough, then make indents over the top of the dough with your thumb.

Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the oven, and brush with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt if desired.

Cool slightly on a wire rack and serve!
