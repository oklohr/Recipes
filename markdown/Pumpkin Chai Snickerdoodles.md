## Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon cream of tarter
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
8 tablespoons butter softened, 1 stick
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### CHAI SPICE SUGAR
1/3 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon all-spice
1/2 teaspoon cardamom
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

## Process
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cream of tarter, salt and nutmeg.

Using an electric mixer, in a large bowl beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the pumpkin, egg, and vanilla and beat until combined. Gradually add the flour mixture, mixing until just fully combined.

Make the chai spice sugar. In a small bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, ginger, all-spice, cardamom, and cloves.

Roll the dough into 1 tablespoon size balls and then generously roll through the chai sugar. Place on the prepared baking sheet, spacing the cookies 2 inches apart. Transfer to the oven and bake for 8-9 minutes or until the cookies are just starting to set around the edges. I find it best to remove the cookies when they still seem doughy in the center. They will cook more on the pan once they are out of the oven. If desired, you can brush the cookies with a little melted butter and sprinkle with the remaining chai sugar. Cool and then store in an airtight container for up to 4 days.
