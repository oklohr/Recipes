## Ingredients
1/2 lb shrimp (Use unfrozen uncooked shrimp. If you have to, you can use unfrozen cooked shrimp - it will work here too)
4 oz sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon paprika
4 garlic cloves minced
1 cup half-and-half or whole milk
1 teaspoon dried basil
Â¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 cup Parmesan cheese , freshly shredded
8 oz fettuccine pasta (use gluten free brown rice fettuccine for gluten free version)

## Process
In a large skillet, saute minced garlic and sun-dried tomatoes (drained from oil) in 2 tablespoons of oil (reserved from the sun-dried tomatoes jar - see note above) for 1 minute until garlic is fragrant.

Add shrimp, sprinkle with a small amount of salt, paprika, and cook on medium heat for about 2 more minutes.

Add half-and-half, basil, and crushed red pepper to the skillet with shrimp, bring to boil and reduce to simmer. Whisk the Parmesan cheese into the hot cream and stir to melt cheese, on the lowest heat setting, until cheese is melted. 

Remove the sauce from heat. Add more salt, basil, and more crushed red pepper if desired, to taste.

In the meantime, cook pasta according to package instructions. Drain (reserving some pasta water).

Add cooked pasta to the creamy mixture, add more salt, basil, and more crushed red pepper if desired, to taste.  If the sauce is too thick, use the reserved pasta water to thin it out.

### Note
If using sun-dried tomatoes in oil (in a jar), make sure to drain sun-dried tomatoes from oil, before using them. Reserve 2 tablespoons of this drained oil for sauteing as described.
