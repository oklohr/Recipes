 [Sausage Ricotta Pepperoni Pizza](https://damndelicious.net/2016/11/29/sausage-ricotta-pepperoni-pizza/) 

## Ingredients
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
8 ounces sweet Italian sausage, casing removed
1/4 cup yellow cornmeal
1 (13.8-ounce can) refrigerated classic pizza crust
1 (8-ounce) can pizza sauce
1/2 cup sliced pepperoni
8 (1-ounce slices) fresh mozzarella cheese
1 cup ricotta cheese
1/4 cup basil leaves

## Process
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Lightly coat a baking sheet or pizza pan with 2 tablespoons olive oil.

Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add Italian sausage and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the sausage as it cooks; drain excess fat.

Working on a surface that has been sprinkled with cornmeal, roll out the pizza into a 12-inch-diameter round. Transfer to prepared baking sheet or pizza pan.

Using a small ladle, spread pizza sauce over the surface of the dough in an even layer, leaving a 1/2-inch border.

Top with sausage, pepperoni, mozzarella and dollops of ricotta.

Place into oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheeses have melted.

Serve immediately, garnished with basil, if desired.
