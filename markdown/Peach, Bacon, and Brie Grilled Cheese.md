[Peach, Bacon, and Brie Grilled Cheese](https://damndelicious.net/2016/08/26/peach-bacon-brie-grilled-cheese/) 

## Ingredients
8 slices bacon
1/4 cup peach preserves
2 peaches, thinly sliced
4 ounces Brie cheese, thinly sliced
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
8 slices whole wheat bread
1 tablespoon honey

## Process
Preheat a waffle iron to medium-high heat. Lightly oil the top and bottom of the waffle iron or coat with nonstick spray.

Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.

With a butter knife, spread butter on one side of each slice of bread. Spread preserves on each of 4 bread slices with buttered side down. Divide peaches, brie and bacon evenly on all slices. Top with remaining slices, buttered side up.

Place sandwiches in the waffle iron. Close gently and cook until golden brown and the cheese has just melted, about 3-4 minutes.

Serve immediately, drizzled with honey, if desired.
