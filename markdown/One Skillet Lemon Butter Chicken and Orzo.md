[One Skillet Lemon Butter Chicken and Orzo. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/one-skillet-lemon-butter-chicken-and-orzo/)

## Ingredients
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 pound chicken breasts or small thighs
Kosher salt and pepper
1 Meyer lemon, sliced
2 tablespoons butter
1 clove garlic, minced or grated
1 cup orzo pasta
1/3 cup white wine
2 1/2 cups low sodium chicken broth
1/2 a bunch kale, roughly torn
Zest + juice of 1 lemon
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill

## Process
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Heat the olive oil in a large dutch oven or cast iron skillet set over medium high heat. Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper. When the oil is shimmering, add the chicken and sear on both sides until golden, about 3-5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet.

To the same skillet, add the butter and lemon slices. Sear the lemon until golden on each side, about 1 minute. Remove the lemon from the pan and add to the plate with the chicken. 

To the same skillet, add the garlic and orzo. Cook until the garlic is fragrant and the orzo toasted, about 2-3 minutes. Add the wine to the skillet and de-glaze the pan. Add the chicken broth, kale, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil over high heat and stir. Slide the chicken, lemon slices, and any juices left on the pan back into the skillet. Transfer to the oven and roast for 15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through

Serve the chicken topped with fresh dill and lemon zest. EAT!
