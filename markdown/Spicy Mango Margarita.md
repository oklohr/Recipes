## Ingredients
½ Ripe Mango – skin & pit removed, and cubed
3 ounces Pineapple Juice
1 ounce Lime Juice
½ Jalapeno - sliced
3 ounces Triple Sec
3 ounces Silver Tequila
1 TBS Grenadine
Agave - to taste (optional)*
Lime – sliced, for garnish
Lime Wedge for wetting the rim
¾ tsp Chili Powder
1 ½ tsp Coarse Salt
1 ½ tsp Granulated Sugar

## Process
For the rim: spread the chili powder, salt and sugar on a small plate. Moisten the rim of 2 glasses with the lime wedge. Dip the edge of the rim into the mixture and gently shake off any excess. Fill the glasses with ice and set aside.

For the mango-pineapple mixture (yield about 1 cup): Add the mango, pineapple juice and lime juice to a blender*. Blend until smooth and creamy. Set aside.

For the cocktail: In a cocktail shaker, muddle 1-4 slices of jalapeño*. Fill the shaker with ice and add the mango mixture, triple sec and tequila. Shake vigorously until the shaker is cold to touch. Strain the margarita into the prepared glasses. 

Slowly pour the grenadine into the margarita. Garnish with the slices of lime and remaining slices of jalapeño. Enjoy!

### Notes
If you like your margarita on the sweeter side, add an ounce or two of agave, or honey, to the blender with the mango. Just make sure you taste the mango-pineapple mixture FIRST, and then add the agave if desired. Depending on the ripeness of your mango, the mixture may be sweet enough without the addition.

If a super spicy margarita is desired, use all four slices of jalapeño. For a milder margarita, use one slice.
