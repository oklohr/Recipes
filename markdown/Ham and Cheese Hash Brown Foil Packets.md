[Ham and Cheese Hash Brown Foil Packets](https://damndelicious.net/2017/10/20/ham-and-cheese-hash-brown-foil-packets/) 

## Ingredients
1 (30-ounce) package frozen shredded hash browns
1 1/2 cups chopped smoked ham
3 tablespoons olive oil
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

## Process
PREHEAT oven to 400 degrees F.

COMBINE hash browns, ham, olive oil, salt and pepper in a large bowl.

CUT six sheets of Reynolds WrapÂ® Heavy Duty Foil, about 12-16-inches long. Lightly oil or coat with nonstick spray. Divide the hash brown mixture into 6 equal portions and add to the center of each foil. Sprinkle with cheese.

FOLD up all 4 sides of each foil packet over the hash browns, covering completely and sealing the packets closed.

PLACE foil packets on a baking sheet. Place into oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and the hash browns are heated through.

SERVE immediately, garnished with chives, if desired.
