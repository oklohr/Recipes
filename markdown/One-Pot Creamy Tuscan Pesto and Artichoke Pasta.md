[One Pot Creamy Tuscan Pesto and Artichoke Pasta. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/one-pot-creamy-tuscan-pesto-and-artichoke-pasta/)

## Ingredients
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 small shallots, chopped
zest from 1 lemon, plus lemon juice for serving
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes
1 pound dry linguine or similar long cut pasta
1 bunch Tuscan kale, finely chopped
kosher salt and black pepper
1/2 cup canned coconut milk or heavy cream
1/2 cup basil pesto
1 (12 ounce) jar marinated artichokes, roughly chopped
1 (14 ounce) can white beans, drained
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped
2 tablespoons fresh dill, roughly chopped
8 ounces burrata cheese (about 2-3 balls)
2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts

## Process
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the shallot and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest and red pepper flakes, cook another minute. Slowly add 4 1/2 cups water, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, the pasta, and kale. Increase the heat to medium-high. Bring the mixture to a boil. Stir frequently until the pasta is al dente, about 10-12 minutes. 

Stir in the coconut milk, pesto, artichokes, and beans. Season, to taste with salt and pepper. Cook until warmed throughout and the pasta is creamy. Remove from the heat, stir the basil and dill.

Divide the pasta between plates and break the burrata over each serving of pasta. Top with pine nuts, additional herbs, lemon juice, and pepper. Enjoy!
