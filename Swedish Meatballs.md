[My Favorite Swedish Meatballs](https://dennistheprescott.com/2018/11/02/my-favourite-swedish-meatballs/)

## Ingredients
⅓ cup bread crumbs
½ cup whole milk
1 free-range egg
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 garlic cloves, minced
¼ teaspoon ground allspice
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon lemon zest, finely grated
½ a medium Spanish onion, finely chopped
¼ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
½ teaspoon kosher salt
1 pound best quality ground beef
½ pound best quality ground pork
1 tablespoon olive oil
5 tablespoons butter
¼ cup all-purpose flour
2 cups beef broth
1 cup heavy (whipping) cream
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
Kosher salt & freshly cracked black pepper

## Process
In a large bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, milk, egg, parsley, garlic, spices, and lemon zest, and mix well. Let sit for about 10 minutes, or until all of the milk has absorbed into the breadcrumbs. Add the onion, beef, pork, salt, and pepper, and mix the lot together. Shape into 16 – 18 large-ish meatballs (if you like smaller meatballs, that’s cool too. Choose your own adventure here, friends).

Heat a large high-sided skillet over medium-heat and melt together the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter. When melted, add the meatballs and cook, turning often,  until browned on all sides and cooked through. Remove the meatballs with a slotted spoon and set aside. Perfect. 

With the pan still over medium-heat, whisk in the remaining butter and flour, and cook until the mixture is bubbling away and browned, 1 – 2 minutes (like you’re making a roux). In a slow and steady stream, whisk in the beef broth and cream, then add the Worcestershire and mustard. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then bring the sauce to a simmer. Cook until thickened and glorious, about 4 – 5 minutes. Add the meatballs back to the skillet and cook another 1 – 2 minutes. Serve with mashed potatoes and your favorite greens (or over egg noodles, if you’re into that sort of thing). Delicious!
