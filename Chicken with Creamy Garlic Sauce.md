[Chicken with Creamy Garlic Sauce - The Midnight Baker](https://bakeatmidnite.com/chicken-with-creamy-garlic-sauce/)

## Ingredients
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
½ cup half-and-half -OR- light cream
1 - 1½ cups Italian flavor bread crumbs
2 tbs olive oil (divided)

### For the Sauce
2 tbs butter
2 tbs finely minced garlic
2 tbs flour
½ cup chicken stock
1 cup cream (heavy cream preferred)
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 oz softened cream cheese
1 tsp salt
¼ tsp white pepper

## Process
Using a meat mallet (smooth side), pound each breast between sheets of plastic wrap or wax paper to ¼-inch thickness. This will give you a pretty large piece of chicken, so what I do is cut each pounded-down breast in half lengthwise.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat; add 1 tbs of the olive oil.

Dip each piece of chicken in the cream, letting excess cream drip off, then dredge in the Italian bread crumbs. You will probably have to cook the chicken in 2 batches.

Place chicken in hot skillet, browning well on each side, about 5 minutes each side, until chicken tests done (175 degrees F or juices run clear when you cut.

Add remaining 1 tbs of oil and repeat browning with remaining chicken.

Place chicken on a platter, cover and keep warm in a 200 degree F oven.

Wipe out the skillet, if desired.

Melt the butter over medium heat and add the garlic.

Cook garlic until it becomes fragrant--about 3-5 minutes--don't let it brown!

Add the flour and blend it well into the butter/garlic. Let this cook about 1 minute.

Slowly add the chicken stock stirring constantly until there are no lumps.

Slowly blend in the cream then add the salt and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes.

Add the Parmesan and cream cheese and stir until the cream cheese melts and blends into the sauce.

Pour sauce over chicken and serve immediately.
