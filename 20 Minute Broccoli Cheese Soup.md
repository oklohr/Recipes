[Broccoli Cheese Soup](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/20-minute-broccoli-cheese-soup/)

## Ingredients
1 tablespoon butter
1 small onion, diced
1 cup diced carrots
3 cups fresh broccoli
2 cups chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon each thyme and garlic powder
salt & pepper to taste
2 tablespoons flour
1 1/2 cups light cream
1 cup sharp cheddar cheese
1/3 cup fresh parmesan cheese

## Process
In a large saucepan, cook butter, onion and carrots over medium heat until onion softens (about 3 minutes). Add chicken broth, broccoli and seasonings. Simmer until broccoli is softened, about 8 minutes.

Remove 1 cup of vegetables, coarsely chop and set aside. Using an immersion blender, blend remaining vegetables and broth.

Place flour in a small bowl. Add in cream a little at a time stirring until smooth. Bring blended vegetable mixture to a boil and whisk in cream mixture. Continue whisking until thick and bubbly, about 3-4 minutes.

Remove from heat, stir in cheeses & reserved chopped vegetables and serve immediately.
