2-3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
Sliced almonds
Wonton strips

### For the Marinade
3 tbsp. soy sauce
2 tsp. brown sugar
1 tsp. sesame oil
1/2 tsp. ground ginger
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1 tbsp. vegetable oil

1/2 cup rice vinegar

2 tbsp. vegetable oil
1 1/2 tsp. sesame oil

Pepper to taste

## Process
Make marinade and marinate chicken for at least 2 hours - overnight is best. Grill or saut√© chicken.
