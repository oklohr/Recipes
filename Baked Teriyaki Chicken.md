[Best Ever Baked Teriyaki Chicken | Creme De La Crumb](https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/best-ever-baked-teriyaki-chicken/)

## Ingredients
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts pounded to even thickness less than 1 inch
1 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce divided
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup rice vinegar
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
2 teaspoons minced garlic
3 tablespoons corn starch
1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds
chopped green onions and steamed rice, for serving

## Process
Preheat oven to 400 degrees and grease a large baking dish or rimmed baking sheet. Arrange chicken in a single layer in the baking dish. 

In a medium sauce pan over high heat combine 1 cup soy sauce, water, rice vinegar, ginger, sugar, crushed red pepper flakes, and garlic and stir to combine. Bring to a boil. 

Once sauce is boiling, whisk together remaining 1/3 cup soy sauce and corn starch until dissolved and stir mixture into boiling sauce. Stir 1-2 minutes until sauce is thickened. 

Remove from heat, stir in sesame seeds, and pour half of the sauce over the chicken in the baking dish. Reserve the remaining sauce for later. Use a fork or tongs to turn chicken over a couple of times to coat in the sauce.

 Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for about 20-25 minutes until chicken is completely cooked through. Drain excess liquid from the baking dish and pour remaining sauce over chicken. Garnish with chopped green onions and additional sesame seeds and serve over rice as desired.
