[Coconut Rice Pudding](http://www.thefoodiecorner.gr/en/slow-cooker-en/slow-cooker-vegan-coconut-rice-pudding-mango-pistachio-recipe/)

## Ingredients 
400 ml coconut milk
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup rice (I used Carolina, which is a short-grain risotto rice like Arborio)
3 Tbs sugar
1/8 tsp salt
250 gr mango slices, drained, from a tin (or equivalent fresh if itâ€™s ripe and juicy)
4-8 tsp raw pistachio nuts, roughly chopped

## Process
Plop the coconut milk, water, rice, sugar and salt in the slow cooker. Turn on low and cook for 3 to 4 hours stirring occasionally. Turn it off when the rice is cooked and the pudding has reached the desired consistency. The longer you leave it the thicker it will be.

Serve with slices of mango on top and a sprinkling of raw pistachio nuts.
