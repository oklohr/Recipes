[One Pot Baked Ziti with Ricotta | Kitchen Nostalgia](https://www.kitchennostalgia.com/pasta/one-pot-baked-ziti-with-ricotta.html)

## Ingredients
230g (8 oz) ziti or penne or similar pasta
1-2 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp butter
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic
3 cups crushed tomatoes with juice
1/2 tsp Italian seasoning (oregano, basil and thyme)
1-2 tsp sugar
1 Tbsp red wine, optional
2 cups water
salt, black pepper
1 cup (230 g) ricotta cheese 
1/2 cup (60 g) mozzarella, cut into small cubes 
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
1 small egg

## Process
OPTIONAL STEP: Soak ziti pasta in salty water while you're preparing the sauce (to shorten cooking time).

Saut√© onion in olive oil and butter until soft. Add garlic, tomatoes, wine, sugar and seasonings and cook for about 5-10 minutes.

Drain pasta, add it together with 2 cups water to tomato sauce in the pot. Bring to boil, cover and cook on low boil, stirring from time to time, until pasta is tender, about 10-15 minutes.

Combine ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan cheese and egg. Season with salt. Stir half of the mixture into pasta and dollop remaining on top.

Transfer the pan to the 500 F (260 C) preheated oven. Bake until cheese has melted and starts browning, about 5 minutes.
