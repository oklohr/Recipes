[Buffalo Chicken Tortilla Pinwheels Recipe - Home Cooking Memories](https://homecookingmemories.com/buffalo-chicken-tortilla-pinwheels/)

## Ingredients
8 ounces cream cheese (softened)
1/2 cup hot wing sauce or cayenne pepper sauce
1/4 cup blue cheese (crumbled)
1 cup Colby-jack cheese (4 ounces, shredded)
1/4 cup green onions (finely chopped)
1 pound chicken breast (cooked and shredded)
5 large flour tortillas (approximately 10 1/2â€³ diameter

## Process
In a bowl, beat cream cheese on low and add in sauce, blue cheese, Colby-jack cheese, and green onions. Beat until blended.

Stir shredded chicken into mixture by hand.

Spread approximately 3/4 cup of mixture on top of one of the tortillas. Roll up tortilla tightly, but without shifting the mixture too much. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Place rolled tortillas on a place and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2-4 hours.

Remove from refrigerator and unwrap. Slice each rolled tortillas in half and then each half into 3 slices, discarding ends. Place pinwheel slices on serving plate or tray.
