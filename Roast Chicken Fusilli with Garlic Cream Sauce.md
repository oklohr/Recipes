[Roast Chicken Fusilli with Garlic Cream Sauce](https://dennistheprescott.com/2015/09/21/roast-chicken-fusilli-with-garlic-cream-sauce/)

## Ingredients
### For the chicken
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh cracked pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
2 tablespoons olive oil

### For the pasta
500 grams fusilli pasta
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon butter
4 cloves of garlic, minced
1/2 cup red onion, finely diced
2 cups spinach
1/2 teaspoon fresh cracked pepper
1/4 cup fresh basil, finely sliced

## Process
Preheat you oven to 425 degrees.

Place your chicken breast in a bowl, and drizzle over your olive oil. In a small dish, mix together your salt, pepper, oregano, basil, cayenne, and lemon zest. Pour the spices over your chicken and give them a massage to get them well coated.

Heat an oven safe pan over medium high. When hot, add your chicken to the pan, and sear both sides for 1 minute each. Transfer the pan to the oven, and roast for 12 minutes.

While the chicken is cooking, bring a large saucepan filled with salted water to a boil. When the water comes to a boil, cook your pasta al dente, according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.

When the chicken is done, transfer to a plate, and place the pan back on the stove top. Heat the pan over medium (do not clean your pan). Drop in 1 tablespoon of butter. When the butter has melted, add your garlic and red onions to the pan, and cook for 2 â€“ 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour in your cream, lemon juice, and cheese, and bring to a simmer. When the cream begins to thicken (about 3 minutes), stir in your spinach and pepper, and remove from the heat. Slice your chicken into strips, and add to the sauce. Pour your sauce over the cooked pasta, and toss together.

Serve, and top with your diced basil.
