## Ingredients
Flour and panko for dredging (half and half)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 lb)
Olive oil as needed
1/4 cup Progresso™ reduced sodium chicken broth from a 32-oz carton
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons minced parsley leaves
1/4-1/2 cup white wine

## Process
Place an inch of flour on a plate and season with salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken breasts in the flour to lightly coat.

Heat a 12-inch skillet, heat oil (1/4 inch) over medium-high heat until a pinch of flour sizzles when dropped in.

When the oil is hot, add chicken breasts to the pan. Cook until the chicken is nicely brown on the first side, about 5 to 7 minutes, then turn and cook on the second side, about 5 to 7 minutes, lowering the heat a bit if the coating begins to scorch. Cook until juice of chicken is clear when center of thickest part is cut (165°F).

When the chicken is done, remove to a plate and tent to keep warm. Add broth, lemon juice and parsley to the pan and cook, stirring until the liquid is reduced by half, about 1 to 2 minutes. Return the chicken breasts to the pan and turn to coat with the sauce.

Slice the chicken breast and serve on a bed of rice and or spinach drizzled with a little more sauce.
