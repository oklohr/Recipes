[Slow Cooker Jambalaya](https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/slow-cooker-jambalaya/)

## Ingredients
1 package andouille sausage
1/2 pound uncooked shrimp (peeled and de-veined)
1 large boneless skinless chicken breast, pounded to even thickness
3 bell peppers (one each of green, red, and yellow or orange), diced
1 white or yellow onion, diced
2-3 jalapeños (see note), seeds and stems removed
1 1/2 cups uncooked white rice
2 cups low sodium chicken broth
1 30-ounce can crushed tomatoes
1 tablespoon minced garlic
3 tablespoons store-bought or homemade cajun seasoning
1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper, or to taste
cilantro or parsley, for topping (optional)

## Process
Slice sausage into sections (about ¼ inch thick slices). Remove tails from shrimp if they are still on. Chop chicken into 1-inch pieces.

Add sausage, chicken, bell peppers, onion, jalapeños, chicken broth, tomatoes, minced garlic, cajun seasoning, and salt and pepper to greased slow cooker and stir to combine. Cover and cook for 3-4 hours on low. Stir in rice and cook another 1-2 hours until rice is fully cooked and tender

About 20 minutes before serving, uncover slow cooker, stir in shrimp, re-cover and cook for another 15-20 minutes. Stir contents of slow cooker, sprinkle with chopped cilantro or parsley if desired, and serve hot.

## Recipe Notes
Two jalapeños will not make this dish real spicy. If you want more of a kick I recommend adding a third jalapeño.
