[Cheese Tortellini in Garlic Butter Sauce](https://www.culinaryhill.com/cheese-tortellini-in-garlic-basil-sauce/)

## Ingredients
32 ounces chicken broth or vegetable broth, divided
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 (16 ounce) package frozen cheese tortellini 
	**see notes**
4 tablespoons butter
2 cloves garlic minced
2 teaspoons dried basil
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese for garnish
Fresh basil for garnish, optional

## Process
In a large pot, bring 2 1/2 cups broth to a boil. Add cheese tortellini. Return to a boil and cook until the tortellini float to the top of the water, about 3 minutes. The internal temperature of a tortellini should be 165ÂºF. Drain completely.

Meanwhile, whisk together remaining 1 1/2 cups broth with corn starch. In a large non-stick skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming. Stir in garlic and basil and cook 2 minutes.

Add broth-cornstarch mixture and bring to a boil; simmer until the mixture thickens, about 2 minutes longer. Add the cooked tortellini to the skillet and toss to coat.

Pour into a serving dish and garnish with Parmesan cheese and parsley, if desired.

## Recipe Notes
Refrigerated tortellini can be substituted; it will float in 2 to 3 minutes. If you want to use dried tortellini, follow the instructions on the package (should be about 10 to 11 minutes).
