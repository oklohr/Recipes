## Ingredients
1 lb fettuccine noodles
1 stick butter
1 cup heavy cream
Salt
Pepper
2 cups freshly grated parmesan

## Process
Cook the pasta according to package directions. 

In a saucepan or skillet over low heat, warm the butter and cream. Season with salt and pepper. Place half of the Parmesan into a large serving bowl. Pour the warm butter/cream mixture over the top. 

Drain the pasta and immediately pour it into the bowl. Toss a couple of times, and then sprinkle in the other half of the Parmesan. Toss to combine, thinning with pasta water if necessary. Serve immediately as a main course or accompaniment to meat or salad. Delicious!
