[Smoked Salmon with Parmesan Zucchini Hash Browns & Chili Mayo](https://dennistheprescott.com/2015/09/13/smoked-salmon-with-parmesan-zucchini-hash-browns-chili-mayo/)

## Ingredients
200 grams smoked salmon

### For the hash browns
1lb potatoes
1 cup zucchini
2 eggs, beaten
1 shallot
2 tablespoons flour
1/3 cup parmesan, grated
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon ground pepper
Vegetable oil, for frying

### For the mayo
1/2 cup mayo
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon chill powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
Serve with sliced lemon

## Process
First, make your mayo. In a small bowl, stir together your mayo, lemon juice, salt, and spices. Place in the fridge until youâ€™re ready to serve.

Next, make your hash browns. Using a food processor (or box grater), grate the potatoes into a large bowl. Grate in your zucchini. Let the potato/zucchini sit for about 10 minutes. Using a clean tea towel, or cheesecloth, squeeze out as much liquid from the vegetables as possible, and place them in a clean bowl. Finely dice your shallot, and add it to the bowl. Add your salt, pepper, flour, parmesan, and beaten eggs, and mix until well combined.

Heat 1/2 inch in a large, deep sided frying pan over medium. Working in batches, fry your hash browns for 6 minutes, turning half way through, until golden brown and cooked through. Sweet, crispy, parmesan-y, deliciousness.

Serve immediately with your chill mayo, smoked salmon, and lemon wedges.
