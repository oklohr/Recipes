## Ingredients
### For the dough
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 1/2 cups tipo 00 flour
2 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons dry active yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup warm water

### For the toppings
1 cup pizza sauce
2 balls of buffalo (or fresh) mozzarella
50 grams prosciutto (about 6 slices)
50 grams coppa ham
50 grams salumi
1/2 cup basil leaves

## Process
In the base of a stand-mixer, combine your yeast, sugar, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and water and stir together. Let the yeast do it’s thing and being nice and foamy (6-8 minutes).

To the bowl add 1/2 of your flour, salt, and the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Knead on low until it starts to come together. Add the rest of your dough, and turn the mixer up 1 notch on the speed dial. Knead for 5 – 6 minutes, until a smooth dough ball forms. Place the dough in a large. lightly oiled bowl, and cover with cling film. Let the dough rise for 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in size.

Preheat your oven, fitted with a baking steel (or pizza stone), to 550 degrees. You want it good and hot, so preheat the oven at least 30 minutes prior to baking your pizzas.

Punch the dough down – yes, really, punch it down so it shrinks into itself – and divide into 2 equal pieces.

Lightly flour your work surface. Working one at a time, roll out your dough into a thin 12 inch round. Top with about 1/2 cup pizza sauce, spreading it over the dough. Then layer on your salami and coppa. Break over your mozzarella and drizzle the pizza with a bit of olive oil. Carefully transfer the pizza to the oven (for me, a pizza peel dusted with cornmeal works best), and bake for 8 – 10 minutes, until the dough is golden brown and the cheese has melted.

Repeat with the second pie.

Top each with your sliced prosciutto and basil leaves.

### Makes 2 12in pizzas.
