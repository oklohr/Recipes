[Blackberry Bacon Pancakes | Dennis The Prescott](https://dennistheprescott.com/2015/04/18/blackberry-bacon-pancakes/)

## Ingredients
1 1/2 cups flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1 heaped teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 egg
1 1/2 cups whole milk
Pinch of salt
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup blackberries
12 pieces of bacon
1 tablespoon maple syrup

## Process
Preheat your oven to 400.

Place your bacon on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Baste the tops of your bacon with maple syrup and bake for 30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until nice and crispy.

While the bacon is cooking, get your pancake on.

In a medium bowl, combine your flour, salt, sugar, baking soda, and powder. In another bowl, whisk together your eggs and milk. Add the wet to your dry ingredients, and whisk until combined.

Heat a pan over medium, and melt your butter. Working in batches, spoon out your pancakes (about 1/4 cup of batter per pancake), and cook each side until golden brown.

Top your cooked pancakes with butter, a handful of blackberries, and 3 slices of bacon.

Also, do yourself a favor and top that stack with maple syrup.
