[creamy cajun linguine : a small batch recipe for two. | a flavor journal.](https://aflavorjournal.com/creamy-cajun-linguine-a-small-batch-recipe-for-two/)

## Ingredients
4 oz. linguine, cooked in boiling salt water
2 Tbsp. butter
1 Tbsp. minced garlic
1 Tbsp. minced shallot
1 Tbsp. Cajun seasonings
1/4 cup white wine
1 Tbsp. lemon juice, freshly squeezed
1/3 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup half and half
1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan
freshly cracked black pepper, to taste
Chopped chives / green onions, for garnish

## Process
Boil linguine in salted water until al dente, then drain. (This can be done while you're making your cajun cream sauce.)

In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.

Add shallot, garlic, cajun seasonings. Stir for about one minute.

Add white wine, and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add lemon juice, cook for one minute (stir a time or two).

Slowly stir in the heavy cream, then the half and half. Allow both to cook in for about 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn heat to low, and allow to thicken for 1-2 minutes.

Remove from heat. Grate in the parmesan, and mix in thoroughly. Add pepper to taste.

Add cooked linguine, and toss to coat. Garnish with thinly diced green onion.

## Notes
If you want a LOT of cream sauce, use 1/2 cup each of half and half and heavy cream, rather than 1/3 cup.

Cajun seasoning typically has enough salt in it, so I recommend only adding pepper to taste at the end!
