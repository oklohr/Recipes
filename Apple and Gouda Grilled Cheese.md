[Apple Grilled Cheese](https://domesticsuperhero.com/apple-grilled-cheese/)

## Ingredients
4 slices of fresh crusty bread - I like sourdough!
1 granny smith apple, peeled and sliced thinly
6 slices smoked or regular Gouda cheese
butter

## Process
Heat your skillet over medium heat. Assemble the sandwiches: bread, 1.5 slices cheese, apple slices, 1.5 slices cheese, then top bread. Repeat for second. Butter top slice of bread.

Lay the sandwiches with the buttered bread touching the skillet. Butter the top piece of bread. Place a sandwich press or heavy bottom skillet on top of the sandwiches to press them down. Cook for 3-4 minutes on first side, or until browned. Flip carefully and cook 2-3 minutes on the other side, allowing to brown (careful â€“ second side usually cooks faster).
