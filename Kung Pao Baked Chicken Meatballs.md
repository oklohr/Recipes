[Kung Pao Meatballs](https://fitfoodiefinds.com/kung-pao-chicken-meatballs/)

## Ingredients
2lb. ground chicken
1/3 cup yellow onion, finely diced
2 large eggs
1/2 cup white whole wheat flour
2/3 cup rolled oatmeal
2 tablespoons sriracha
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
4 teaspoons minced garlic

### For The Sauce
1/2 cup soy sauce (option tamari or coconut aminos)
1/4 cup sriracha
1/4 cup red chili paste
1/4 cup honey

## Process
First, preheat oven to 400ºF and spray a baking sheet with coconut oil cooking spray. Set aside.

Next, prep chicken meatballs mixture by placing all ingredients into a large bowl and mixing until combined.

Scoop out a heaping scoop of mixture and mold into a ball with your hands. It works best if your hands are slightly wet with water. Place on baking sheet and repeat.

Bake meatballs at 400ºF for 25-28 minutes or until the top begins to turn golden brown.

While the meatballs are cooking, prep the kung pao sauce, by mixing all ingredients together in a small bowl.

Once the meatballs have slightly cooled, toss in sauce. Serve hot!
