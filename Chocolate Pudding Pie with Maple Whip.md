[Chocolate Pudding Pie with Maple Whip](https://dennistheprescott.com/2018/10/14/chocolate-pudding-pie-with-maple-whip/)

## Ingredients
### Graham Cracker Crust
1 ½ cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs
⅓ cup sugar
⅓ cup melted butter

### Pudding
¼ cup cornstarch
⅓ cup sugar
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
¼ teaspoons sea salt
3 cups whole milk
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, broken into 1/2 -inch pieces
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

### Maple Whip
1 cup chilled heavy (whipping) cream
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup

### Garnish
Grated Milk Chocolate
Icing Sugar

## Process
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F.

Crust time. Combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter in a bowl and mix until well blended. Press the mixture into a 9-inch pie plate, covering the base and sides evenly. Bake for 7 minutes, until lightly golden brown, then cool completely. Perfect.

Pudding time. In a 3-quart saucepan, whisk together the cornstarch, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt, then whisk in the milk in a slow and steady stream until smooth. Whisking constantly, bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. When the mixture comes to a boil, cook for 2 minutes then remove from the heat. Whisk in the bittersweet chocolate and vanilla until smooth. Awesome.

Pour the pudding mixture into the prepared pie plate, then transfer to the fridge and chill for a few hours until set (minimum 2 – 3 hours. Patience, friends).

Before serving, whip the cream in a bowl until stiff peaks form. Whisk in the maple syrup until smooth and combined, then spoon over top of the pie. Hit the pie with grated chocolate, a bit of icing sugar, and serve. Delicious!
