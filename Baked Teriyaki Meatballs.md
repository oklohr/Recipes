## Process
Heat oven to 400Â° F. In a stand mixer or using your hands, mix all ingredients for the meatballs until fully incorporated. Using a cookie scoop or heaping tablespoon, measure out roughly 35 meatballs. ** Dipping your hand into a bowl of water before rolling them will make the meatball surface smooth. Transfer the meatballs  2 lightly oiled parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets.

Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pans half way through.

Once the sauce has cooled and thickened a bit, pour it over the meatballs and roasted broccoli. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro and serve.

** Teriyaki sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Meatballs can be formed 1 days ahead. Cover with plastic wrap on a rimmed baking sheet and chill.
