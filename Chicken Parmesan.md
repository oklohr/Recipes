[Chicken Parmesan](https://thefeedfeed.com/thedaleyplate/chicken-parmesan)

## Ingredients
1 (16 ounce) mozzarella cheese log**
1 tbsp fresh oregano
1 tbsp dried basil
1 tsp red pepper flakes
1/2 cup fine almond flour
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 egg, beaten
2 large chicken breasts, split in half lengthways
1/2 cup olive oil, divided
1 tbsp kosher salt
1 tsp crushed black pepper
2 cups marinara
2 campari or other tomatoes, sliced

Optional garnish: Fresh oregano, basil and cracked black pepper

## Process
Preheat oven to Broil. Season BelGioioso Fresh Mozzarella with oregano, basil and red pepper flakes and drizzle with ¼ cup olive oil. Set aside to marinate.**

In a shallow bowl, whisk almond flour and BelGioioso Grated Parmesan with a fork to combine. Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper, then dip in egg mixture followed by a dredge in almond flour cheese mixture.

Heat a large ovenproof skillet to medium-high and add remaining olive oil. Shallow fry the chicken cutlets fry for 2-3 minutes per side and remove chicken. Add marinara to skillet and place the chicken on top, followed by the marinated BelGioioso Fresh Mozzarella slices.

Broil for 5 minutes in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbling and chicken registers 165˚F when using a thermometer. Remove skillet from oven and top with fresh tomato slices, followed by fresh oregano and cracked pepper. Serve immediately.

## Olivia's Notes**
Get shredded mozzarella, not a log.

Don't marinate the mozzarella, add the spices to the breading.
