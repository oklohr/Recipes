# Recipes

This repository has _nothing_ to do with coding, but acts as a source-of-truth and a backup for all of the recipes I use / like. It's more accessible than a cookbook, and it also means I don't have to write out grocery lists - I can just pull the recipes I'm making for the week up on my phone when I get to the grocery store.

The recipes are available in PDF for easy reading and markdown for downloading and importing into a notes app, like [Bear](https://bear.app/).
