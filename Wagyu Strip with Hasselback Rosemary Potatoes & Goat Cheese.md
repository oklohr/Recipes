[Wagyu Strip with Hasselback Rosemary Potatoes & Goat Cheese](https://dennistheprescott.com/2017/10/23/wagyu-striploin-with-hasselback-rosemary-sweet-potatoes-goat-cheese/)

## Ingredients
### Steak
2 X 1.5-inch Lone Mountain Wagyu Strip Steaks
2 teaspoons olive oil
Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
2 tablespoons butter
1 sprig rosemary
2 cloves of garlic, skin on
Finishing salt, for sprinkling

### Potatoes
6 medium-sized potatoes
¼ cup olive oil
1 sprig of fresh rosemary, leaves picked
4 cloves of garlic
Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper

### Asparagus
1 pound asparagus, ends trimmed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon zest
Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper

### Garnish
4-ounces goat cheese
1 lemon, cut into wedges
Roasted garlic, if that suits your fancy.

## Process
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.

Carefully cut multiple 1/8-inch slices along of the length of each potato, slicing 2/3 of the way through.

Rub the oil all over the potatoes, then transfer to the baking tray. Season the tops of each potato generously with salt and pepper. Sprinkle over the rosemary leaves, then add the garlic to the pan.

Transfer the potatoes to the oven and roast for about 1 hour, basting the potatoes with the oil at the bottom of the pan halfway through. When the spuds are nice and tender on the inside, and golden and crispy on the outside they’re ready to go.

While the potatoes are roasting, prepare the steak. Remove the steak from the fridge and transfer it to a plate. Massage the steaks with olive oil, then coat each side generously with salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Allow the steak to warm to room temperature on the counter, about 30 minutes.

Heat a large cast iron (or heavy-bottomed) pan over high heat. When the pan is blazing hot, add the steaks and set a timer. Cook, turning every minute, for 10 minutes total for medium-rare doneness (cook longer if you like your steak more well done). When there is 2 minutes cook time remaining, add the butter, garlic, and rosemary to the pan, and baste continually over the steak.

Transfer the cooked steak to a plate, pour over any pan juices, and rest at least 6 minutes before carving.

While the steak is resting, bring a large pot of water to a boil, add the asparagus, and cook for about 5 minutes, until tender but still firm. Toss with the olive oil and lemon zest, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.

Carve the steak against the grain into thin strips and transfer to a serving board. Pour over the heavenly plate juices and top with a pinch of finishing salt. Serve with the potatoes, goat cheese, asparagus, and lemon wedges. Delicious!
