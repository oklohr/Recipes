[Peanut Butter Cookie Lasagna](https://hugsandcookiesxoxo.com/2015/02/peanut-butter-cookie-lasagna.html)

## Ingredients
1 box Nutter Butter Cookies
Cool Whip
Peanut butter cups
½ cup peanut butter, melted in microwave
1 box instant vanilla pudding, prepared according to package

## Process
Line the bottom of an 8x8 pan with Nutter Butter Cookies.

Top with a drizzle of the melted peanut butter. Add ½ the pudding.

Add half the cool whip. (I like to use a pastry bag so it is pretty but you can spread it if you prefer.) Top with chopped peanut butter cups.

Repeat the layering!

Decorate the top with crushed nutter butter cookies, peanut butter cups and a drizzle more of peanut butter.

This must be chilled overnight for the cookies to soften! We are talking 24 hours or more-a little tip to speed the softening up....halve the cookies lengthwise (don't worry about the cream) and layer them halved. Or you could even chop the cookies and use chopped cookies in the layers! Either way you choose will be delicious!!!
