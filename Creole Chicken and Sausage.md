[Slow Cooker Creole Chicken and Sausage Recipe - Pinch of Yum](http://pinchofyum.com/slow-cooker-creole-chicken-sausage)

## Ingredients
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts
12 ounces smoked Andouille sausage, cut into small rounds
1 cup chopped onions
2 cloves minced garlic
1 1/4 cup low sodium chicken broth
1 can (14.5 ounces) diced tomatoes
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup tomato sauce
2 teaspoons Creole seasoning
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
### Optional Extras:
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 14 ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained
2 green bell peppers, chopped
1/2 cup sliced green onions for topping
2 tablespoons almond butter (randomly delicious)
salt to taste
brown rice for serving

## Process
Place the essential ingredients in the crockpot. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3 hours.

Shred the chicken directly in the crockpot to your desired texture. Add the extras, if you want, and cover and cook for another 20-30 minutes. This is also a great time to make your rice, if youâ€™re serving it with rice. When everything is ready, taste the chicken mixture and season with salt. Serve the creole chicken over rice and topped with green onions.
