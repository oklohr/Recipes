[30 Minute Thai Peanut Chicken Ramen. - Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/20-minute-thai-peanut-chicken-ramen/)

## Ingredients
4 cups low sodium chicken broth
1 can (14 ounce) coconut milk
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons honey
1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
1/4 cup Thai red curry paste
3/4 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
8 ounces crimini mushrooms, sliced
2 red bell peppers, chopped
1 inch fresh ginger, grated
1 clove garlic, minced or grated
2-4 squares ramen noodles
juice of 1 lime
3 cups fresh baby spinach
1/3 cup fresh basil or cilantro, roughly chopped, plus more for serving
chopped peanuts and toasted sesame oil, for serving

## Process
In a large soup pot, combine the chicken broth, coconut milk, soy sauce, fish sauce, honey, peanut butter, and curry paste. Add the chicken, crimini mushrooms, red peppers, ginger, and garlic. Set over medium heat on the stove and bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and shreds easily.

Once done cooking, shred the chicken.

Bring the soup to a boil over high heat. Stir in the noodles, lime juice, spinach, and cilantro. Let sit 5 minutes or until the noodles are soft.

Ladle the soup into bowls and top with peanuts and toasted sesame oil. Enjoy!

### RECIPE NOTES
I recommend storing the soup and noodles separately, then adding the noodles just before serving. If you let the noodles sit in the soup, they will soak up all the broth and become very mushy.
