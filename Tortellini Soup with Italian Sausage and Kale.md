## Ingredients
1 lb mild Italian sausage, ground
1 onion, minced
6 garlic cloves, minced
1 quart chicken stock
1 (14 oz can) crushed tomatoes
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 tsp salt
1 bunch kale, stems removed
1 (10 oz) bag tortellini, fresh (not dried)
1 cup heavy cream
Parmesan cheese (optional)
¼ tsp red pepper flakes (optional)

## Process
Heat a large soup pot over medium-high heat.

Add the sausage, onions and garlic to the pot and and sauté until the onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. (Drain off any excessive fat.)

Add the chicken stock, crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Whisk until tomato paste is fully incorporated.

Bring to a boil, season with salt then simmer for 15 minutes.
