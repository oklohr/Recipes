[Lemon Rosemary Chicken with Fingerling Potatoes, Green Beans, & Goats Cheese](https://dennistheprescott.com/2015/09/02/1137/)

## Ingredients
4 chicken breasts
2 lbs fingerling potatoes, washed and scrubbed
2 cups green beans, ends cut
3 cloves of garlic, peeled
1 lemon
1/2 cup goats cheese
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, diced fine
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
1/2 cup purslane
Fresh parsley and diced radishes, to garnish.

## Process
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.

Place your chicken breasts in a bowl. Drizzle in 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, and sprinkle over your lemon zest, rosemary, and 1/4 teaspoon salt & pepper. Massage the lemon oil into your chicken. Set aside.

Place your scrubbed potatoes in a large saucepan full of cold, salted water. Bring to a boil, and cook for 5 â€“ 6 minutes, until just fork tender. Drain, place the potatoes back in the pan, drizzle over 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper. Give them a toss to get the outsides nice and puffed. This will help them become nice and crispy as they bake.

Heat a large frying pan over medium. When the pan is hot, brown both sides of your chicken breasts, (about 1 minute per side). Place the chicken in a baking tray, and pour in your potatoes, making a single layer. Cut your lemon in half, and add it along with your garlic to the tray. Bake in your preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, turning the potatoes halfway through. When you have 10 minutes left in the cooking process, scatter your green beans overtop of the tray.

Crumble your goats cheese over the hot tray, letting it melt nicely. Add your purslane, and garnish with fresh parsley and diced radishes.
